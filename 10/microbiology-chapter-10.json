      ],
      "answer": "The mice will die. Transformation was not required.",
      "explanation": "Live S (smooth) strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae are virulent. If live S-strain bacteria are administered, the mice will die due to the virulence of the S strain itself, regardless of the presence of dead R (rough) strain. Transformation is not the primary cause of death in this specific scenario as described."

      "answer": "The Hershey-Chase experiment aimed to distinguish whether DNA or protein entered the bacterial cell to direct new virus production. Bacteriophages naturally separate their protein coat from their nucleic acid during infection (protein stays outside, DNA enters). This clear separation was crucial for the experiment's design, allowing them to label DNA and protein differently and track which molecule entered the cell. Animal viruses entering whole would have made it impossible to distinguish which component was responsible without further complex separation steps inside the cell.",

      "answer": "Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) base pairs are held together by three hydrogen bonds, whereas Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) base pairs are held by two hydrogen bonds. DNA with a higher GC content has more G-C pairs, resulting in more hydrogen bonds overall. This increased number of hydrogen bonds requires more energy (e.g., higher temperature) to break, making high GC-content DNA more stable and difficult to denature.",
      "explanation": "G-C base pairs have three hydrogen bonds, while A-T pairs have two. Higher GC content means more hydrogen bonds, requiring more energy to separate the strands."

      "answer": "Although RNA is typically single-stranded, it can fold back on itself. Complementary base pairing (A with U, and G with C) between different regions of the same RNA molecule allows it to form secondary structures like hairpin loops, stem-loops, and pseudoknots. These structures are crucial for the function of many RNA molecules (e.g., tRNA, rRNA).",
      "explanation": "Regions of an RNA strand can fold back and base-pair with other complementary sequences within the same molecule, forming secondary structures like stem-loops, which are important for RNA function."

      "answer": "The mRNA sequence will be complementary and antiparallel to the antisense RNA. Antisense: 5ʹ-AUUCGAAUGC-3ʹ. mRNA: 3ʹ-UAAGCUUACG-5ʹ. Written in the 5' to 3' direction, the mRNA is: 5ʹ-GCAUUCGAAU-3ʹ.",
      "explanation": "The mRNA will be complementary (A with U, U with A, C with G, G with C) and antiparallel to the antisense RNA. So, for 5ʹ-AUUCGAAUGC-3ʹ antisense, the mRNA is 5ʹ-GCAUUCGAAU-3ʹ."

      "text": "Why does double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulate RNA interference?",
      "answer": "Double-stranded RNA is not commonly found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and is often a sign of viral infection or transposon activity. Cells have evolved RNA interference (RNAi) as a defense mechanism. dsRNA is recognized and processed by cellular machinery (like Dicer enzyme) into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which then guide a complex (RISC) to target and degrade complementary mRNAs, silencing gene expression.",
      "explanation": "dsRNA is often a hallmark of viral infection or mobile genetic elements. Cells recognize it as foreign or aberrant, triggering the RNAi pathway to degrade the dsRNA and corresponding mRNA, thus silencing gene expression as a defense mechanism."

      "text": "What are some differences in chromosomal structures between prokaryotes and eukaryotes?",
      "answer": "Prokaryotes typically have a single, circular chromosome located in the nucleoid region, not enclosed by a membrane. Eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes contained within a membrane-bound nucleus. Eukaryotic chromosomes are also associated with histone proteins to form chromatin, while prokaryotic DNA is associated with histone-like proteins but is less extensively packaged.",
      "explanation": "Prokaryotes: usually single, circular chromosome in nucleoid, no histones (histone-like proteins instead). Eukaryotes: multiple, linear chromosomes in nucleus, complexed with histone proteins to form chromatin."

      "text": "How do prokaryotes and eukaryotes manage to fit their lengthy DNA inside of cells? Why is this necessary?",
      "answer": "Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use supercoiling to compact their DNA. Prokaryotes use DNA gyrase and histone-like proteins to supercoil their circular chromosome into looped domains. Eukaryotes package DNA more elaborately by wrapping it around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which then coil and fold into higher-order chromatin structures. This compaction is necessary because the uncoiled length of DNA is many times larger than the cell itself, and it needs to be organized to fit within the cell and allow for regulated access for replication and transcription.",
      "explanation": "DNA is compacted by supercoiling and, in eukaryotes, by wrapping around histone proteins to form chromatin. This is necessary to fit the very long DNA molecule into the relatively small volume of the cell and to organize it for proper function."

      "answer": "Noncoding DNA has various functions, including: regulation of gene expression (e.g., promoters, enhancers, silencers), production of functional non-coding RNA molecules (e.g., tRNA, rRNA, siRNA, miRNA), defining chromosome structure (e.g., centromeres, telomeres), and providing sites for DNA-binding proteins. Some noncoding DNA may also have roles in genome evolution.",

      "answer": "If the nuclei were in the stalks: Graft A (foot of A. mediterranea, stalk of A. crenulata) would develop a cap characteristic of A. crenulata because the stalk containing the A. crenulata nucleus would dictate cap morphology. Graft B (foot of A. crenulata, stalk of A. mediterranea) would develop a cap characteristic of A. mediterranea because the stalk containing the A. mediterranea nucleus would dictate cap morphology. The cap type would be determined by the origin of the stalk, not the foot.",

      "answer": "Although DNA was discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, its role as the hereditary material was not known. For a long time, proteins were considered more likely candidates due to their greater complexity. The Hershey-Chase experiment in 1952 provided strong, direct evidence that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material. They used bacteriophages with radioactively labeled DNA (32P) and protein (35S) and showed that only the labeled DNA entered the bacterial host cells to direct the production of new phages. This experiment was pivotal in convincing the scientific community of DNA's role.",

      "answer": "According to Chargaff's rules: Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), so if T = 22%, then A = 22%. The total percentage of A + T = 22% + 22% = 44%. The remaining percentage for Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) is 100% - 44% = 56%. Since G pairs with C, they must be equal: G = C = 56% / 2 = 28%. So, Adenine = 22%, Guanine = 28%, Cytosine = 28%.",

      "answer": "The DNA double helix has a consistent diameter because a purine (larger, two-ring structure) always pairs with a pyrimidine (smaller, single-ring structure). If two purines paired, the helix would bulge or be too wide at that point. If two pyrimidines paired, the helix would constrict or be too narrow at that point. These irregular pairings would distort the helical structure and likely affect its stability and function.",
      "explanation": "Purine-purine pairing would cause the helix to be too wide at that point. Pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairing would cause it to be too narrow. The consistent diameter of the DNA helix relies on purine-pyrimidine pairing."

      "text": "Why does it make sense that tRNA and rRNA molecules are more stable than mRNA molecules?",
      "answer": "tRNA and rRNA molecules are structural and catalytic components of the translation machinery (ribosomes and adaptors for amino acids). They are needed repeatedly for protein synthesis and thus require stability to function over extended periods and for many rounds of translation. mRNA molecules, on the other hand, carry transient messages for specific proteins. Their relatively lower stability allows cells to rapidly adjust protein synthesis levels in response to changing needs; old mRNAs are degraded, and new ones are synthesized as required. If mRNAs were too stable, cells could not quickly stop producing a protein when it's no longer needed.",
      "explanation": "tRNA and rRNA are involved in the constant process of translation and need to be reused, so stability is advantageous. mRNA provides a temporary blueprint for protein synthesis; its relative instability allows for rapid changes in gene expression by degrading old messages and synthesizing new ones."

      "answer": "In double-stranded DNA, according to Chargaff's rules, A should equal T, and G should equal C. Here, A (15%) ≠ T (35%), and C (20%) ≠ G (30%). This indicates that the genome of the bacteriophage is not double-stranded DNA. It is most likely single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or possibly RNA (though uracil would be expected instead of thymine if it were RNA, unless T is used as a shorthand for U in this context, which is less likely for base composition analysis). Given the presence of Thymine, it is most likely ssDNA.",
      "explanation": "The base composition does not follow Chargaff's rules for double-stranded DNA (A≠T and G≠C). Therefore, the genome is likely single-stranded. Since Thymine is present, it is likely single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)."
