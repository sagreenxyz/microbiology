      ],
      "answer": "The mice will die. Transformation was not required.",
      "explanation": "This question seems to misstate Griffith's experiment. If it refers to dead S (smooth, virulent) and live R (rough, non-virulent) strains, the mice die due to transformation of live R cells by genetic material from dead S cells. If it means dead R and live S, the live S strain is virulent and will kill the mice on its own, no transformation needed from R."

      "text": "Which of the following best describes the results from Hershey and Chase’s experiment using bacterial viruses with 35S-labeled proteins or 32P-labeled DNA that are consistent with protein being the molecule responsible for hereditary?",
      "options": [
        "After infection with the 35S-labeled viruses and centrifugation, only the pellet would be radioactive.",
        "After infection with the 32P-labeled viruses and centrifugation, only the pellet would be radioactive.",
        "After infection with the 32P-labeled viruses and centrifugation, both the pellet and the supernatant would be radioactive.",
        "After infection with the 35S-labeled viruses and centrifugation, both the pellet and the supernatant would be radioactive."
      ],
      "answer": "After infection with the 35S-labeled viruses and centrifugation, only the pellet would be radioactive.",
      "explanation": "If protein were the hereditary material, the 35S-labeled protein coat would enter the bacteria (pellet). Hershey and Chase found 32P (DNA) in the pellet and 35S (protein) mostly in the supernatant, supporting DNA as the genetic material. This option describes the *opposite* of what would support protein as genetic material based on their actual findings."

        "carbohydrate-degrading enzymes",
        "proteinases",
        "deoxyribonucleases"
      ],
      "answer": "deoxyribonucleases",
      "explanation": "This question relates more to the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment. Deoxyribonucleases degrade DNA. If DNA is the transforming principle (hereditary material), then treating the extract from pathogenic bacteria with deoxyribonuclease would prevent transformation of nonpathogenic bacteria. Beadle and Tatum's hypothesis linked genes to enzymes involved in metabolic pathways."

        "amino acids",
        "complementary base pairing"
      ],
      "answer": "amino acids",
      "explanation": "DNA is composed of deoxyribonucleotides (containing bases like thymine), linked by phosphodiester bonds, and exhibits complementary base pairing. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA."
