      "id": 19,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "Explain how a prism separates white light into different colors.",
      "answer": "A prism separates white light into its constituent colors because different wavelengths (colors) of light are refracted (bent) by different amounts as they pass through the prism. Shorter wavelengths (like violet and blue) are bent more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange), causing the colors to spread out into a spectrum.",
      "explanation": "Different wavelengths of light travel at slightly different speeds in a medium like glass. This causes each wavelength to be refracted at a slightly different angle, dispersing the white light into a spectrum of colors."

      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "Why is Antonie van Leeuwenhoek’s work much better known than that of Zaccharias Janssen?",
      "answer": "Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's work is better known because he was meticulous in his observations, kept detailed records, and communicated his findings extensively with the Royal Society of London. While Janssen likely invented the compound microscope earlier, Leeuwenhoek's simple microscopes were of higher quality for his time, and his detailed descriptions of 'animalcules' (microorganisms) were groundbreaking and widely disseminated.",
      "explanation": "Leeuwenhoek was a skilled lens grinder who built high-quality simple microscopes and meticulously documented his observations of microorganisms, sharing them with the scientific community. Janssen was more of an instrument maker, and detailed records of his observations, if any, are not as prominent."

      "text": "Why did the cork cells observed by Robert Hooke appear to be empty, as opposed to being full of other structures?",
      "answer": "The cork cells Robert Hooke observed appeared empty because he was looking at dead plant tissue. The living contents of the cells (cytoplasm, organelles) had long since decomposed, leaving only the rigid cell walls. These empty, box-like structures were what he named 'cells'.",
      "explanation": "Hooke was observing cork, which is composed of dead plant cells. The cellular contents (protoplasm) had degraded, leaving only the cell walls, which formed the empty chambers he described."

      "text": "What is the function of the condenser in a brightfield microscope?",
      "answer": "The condenser in a brightfield microscope focuses the light from the illuminator onto the specimen. It gathers the light rays and directs them through the specimen, ensuring that the specimen is brightly and evenly illuminated for optimal viewing.",
      "explanation": "The condenser lens system collects and concentrates light from the illuminator, focusing it onto the specimen to provide optimal illumination for viewing through the objective and ocular lenses."

      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "How could you identify whether a particular bacterial sample contained specimens with mycolic acid-rich cell walls?",
      "answer": "You would use an acid-fast staining procedure, such as the Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun method. Bacteria with mycolic acid-rich cell walls (like Mycobacterium species) will resist decolorization by acid-alcohol after being stained with carbolfuchsin and will appear red or pink. Non-acid-fast bacteria will be decolorized and will take up the counterstain (e.g., methylene blue), appearing blue.",
      "explanation": "Acid-fast staining (e.g., Ziehl-Neelsen stain) is used. Acid-fast bacteria (with mycolic acid) retain the primary stain (carbolfuchsin, appearing red) despite decolorization with acid-alcohol. Non-acid-fast bacteria lose the primary stain and take up the counterstain.",

      "answer": "infrared rays",

      "type": "critical-thinking",
      "text": "When focusing a light microscope, why is it best to adjust the focus using the coarse focusing knob before using the fine focusing knob?",
      "answer": "The coarse focusing knob moves the stage (or objective lens) up or down in large increments, allowing for rapid initial focusing to bring the specimen into approximate focus, especially at lower magnifications. Once the image is roughly focused, the fine focusing knob, which moves the stage in very small increments, is used for sharp, precise focusing. Using the coarse knob first prevents overshooting the focal plane and makes it easier and quicker to find the specimen. At high magnifications, using the coarse knob can easily move the objective past the focal plane or even crash it into the slide.",
      "explanation": "The coarse focusing knob allows for large-scale movement to quickly bring the specimen into approximate focus. The fine focusing knob is then used for precise, small adjustments to achieve a sharp image. Starting with the fine knob would be very slow and inefficient."

      "text": "You need to identify structures within a cell using a microscope. However, the image appears very blurry even though you have a high magnification. What are some things that you could try to improve the resolution of the image? Describe the most basic factors that affect resolution when you first put the slide onto the stage; then consider more specific factors that could affect resolution for 40⨯ and 100⨯ lenses.",
      "answer": "Basic factors: 1. Cleanliness: Ensure the slide, coverslip, and microscope lenses (ocular, objective, condenser) are clean. 2. Illumination: Adjust the diaphragm and condenser for optimal light. Too much or too little light can reduce contrast and perceived resolution. 3. Focus: Use the fine focus knob carefully. For 40x and 100x lenses: 1. Immersion oil (for 100x objective): Ensure proper use of immersion oil with the 100x oil immersion lens. This increases the numerical aperture and thus resolution by reducing light refraction. 2. Coverslip: Ensure a coverslip is used and is of the correct thickness if specified for the objectives. 3. Condenser position: Adjust the condenser height; it should typically be close to the stage for higher magnifications. 4. Numerical Aperture (NA): Higher NA objectives provide better resolution. Ensure the objective is suitable. 5. Wavelength of light: While not easily changed on standard microscopes, shorter wavelengths (e.g., blue light, if a filter is available) can slightly improve resolution.",
      "explanation": "To improve blurry image/resolution: Ensure lenses and slide are clean. Adjust illumination (diaphragm, condenser). Use fine focus carefully. For 40x/100x: Use immersion oil with 100x objective. Ensure correct coverslip use. Adjust condenser position. Shorter wavelength light (if possible) can help. Resolution depends on wavelength of light and numerical aperture of the lens."

      "text": "You use the Gram staining procedure to stain an L-form bacterium (a bacterium that lacks a cell wall). What color will the bacterium be after the staining procedure is finished?",
      "answer": "An L-form bacterium, lacking a cell wall, will likely stain pink/red, like a Gram-negative bacterium. The Gram stain differentiates based on the ability of the cell wall (specifically the thick peptidoglycan layer in Gram-positives) to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex after decolorization. Without a cell wall to retain this complex, the L-form bacterium will lose the crystal violet during the decolorization step and will then take up the safranin counterstain.",
      "explanation": "L-forms lack a cell wall. The Gram stain's differential step relies on the cell wall structure (peptidoglycan thickness) to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex. Without a cell wall, the L-form will likely lose the primary stain during decolorization and be counterstained pink/red by safranin, appearing Gram-negative."
