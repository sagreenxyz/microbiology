This condition (n+n) arises after plasmogamy (fusion of cytoplasm from two parent hyphae) but before karyogamy (fusion of the nuclei). Dikaryotic hyphae are characteristic of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota life cycles and can persist for a significant portion of the fungus's life.",

      "id": 31,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "Why are algae not considered parasitic?",
      "answer": "Algae are primarily photosynthetic organisms, meaning they produce their own food (autotrophs) using light energy, carbon dioxide, and water. Parasites, by definition, live in or on another organism (the host) and derive nutrients at the host's expense, causing harm. Since algae are producers and do not typically harm a host to obtain nutrients, they are not considered parasitic. Some algae can form symbiotic relationships (like lichens or with corals), but these are generally mutualistic or commensal, not parasitic.",
      "explanation": "Algae are autotrophs (photosynthetic) and produce their own food; they do not live at the expense of a host organism like parasites do."

Bioindicators: Many lichens are very sensitive to air pollution (especially sulfur dioxide). Their presence, absence, or health can indicate air quality. 3. Food source and habitat: Lichens serve as a food source for various animals (e.g., reindeer, caribou) and provide habitat and shelter for small invertebrates.",

      "text": "Protist taxonomy has changed greatly in recent years as relationships have been re-examined using newer approaches. How do newer approaches differ from older approaches?",
      "answer": "Older approaches to protist taxonomy relied heavily on morphological characteristics (e.g., cell shape, organelles, mode of locomotion, nutritional strategy). Newer approaches increasingly use molecular data, especially DNA and RNA sequence analysis (e.g., rRNA gene sequencing, whole-genome sequencing), and ultrastructural analysis (electron microscopy) to infer evolutionary relationships (phylogeny). These molecular methods often reveal relationships not apparent from morphology alone and have led to significant revisions of protist classification, moving away from purely form-based groups to more evolutionarily meaningful clades.",

      "answer": "Characteristics suggesting pathogenicity: 1. Heterotrophic nutrition, especially if it involves phagocytosis of host cells or absorption of nutrients from host tissues (parasitism). 2. Ability to invade host tissues or cells. 3. Production of toxins or enzymes that damage host cells. 4. Mechanisms to evade the host immune system (e.g., antigenic variation, intracellular lifestyle). While no single method of locomotion is exclusively linked to pathogenicity, flagella or pseudopods can aid in motility and tissue invasion. Morphological adaptations like apical complexes (in Apicomplexans) are specifically for host cell penetration. An intracellular lifestyle is strongly associated with pathogenicity.",
      "explanation": "Pathogenic protists are often heterotrophic parasites. They may possess structures for host cell invasion (e.g., apical complex) or motility (flagella, pseudopods) that aid in infection. An intracellular lifestyle or ability to evade host immunity are also key indicators."

      "answer": "Chitin is a major structural component of fungal cell walls but is absent in human cells. Understanding the pathways of chitin synthesis in fungi can lead to the development of antifungal drugs that specifically target these pathways. Such drugs would have selective toxicity, inhibiting fungal growth or killing fungal cells without harming human cells. This is crucial for treating fungal infections (mycoses), as fungi are eukaryotes like humans, making it harder to find unique drug targets compared to bacteria.",
      "explanation": "Chitin is essential for fungal cell walls but not found in humans. Targeting chitin synthesis pathways allows for the development of antifungal drugs with selective toxicity, minimizing harm to human cells while effectively treating fungal infections."
