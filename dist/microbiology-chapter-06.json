      "text": "Briefly explain the difference between the mechanism of entry of a T-even bacteriophage and an animal virus.",
      "answer": "A T-even bacteriophage attaches to the bacterial cell wall and injects its DNA into the host cytoplasm, leaving the capsid outside. Animal viruses can enter host cells through different mechanisms: enveloped viruses often fuse their envelope with the host cell membrane or are taken in by endocytosis, while non-enveloped viruses typically enter by endocytosis. In these cases, the entire virion or at least its nucleocapsid enters the cell.",
      "explanation": "T-even phages inject their DNA into the bacterium, leaving the capsid outside. Animal viruses enter the host cell whole, either by endocytosis or, if enveloped, by membrane fusion."

      "id": 29,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "Discuss the difference between generalized and specialized transduction.",
      "answer": "Generalized transduction occurs when any random piece of bacterial DNA is accidentally packaged into a phage head during the lytic cycle; this phage can then transfer this DNA to another bacterium. Specialized transduction occurs when a temperate phage excises imprecisely from the host chromosome during induction from the lysogenic cycle, taking specific adjacent bacterial genes with it. These specific genes are then transferred when the phage infects a new host.",
      "explanation": "Generalized transduction: random bacterial DNA fragment is packaged into a phage. Specialized transduction: specific bacterial genes adjacent to the prophage integration site are packaged."

      "text": "Differentiate between lytic and lysogenic cycles.",
      "answer": "Lytic cycle: The phage replicates and lyses the host cell to release new virions, leading to host cell death. Lysogenic cycle: The phage DNA integrates into the host chromosome (as a prophage) or exists as a plasmid, replicating along with the host cell without immediately causing lysis. The prophage can later be induced to enter the lytic cycle.",
      "explanation": "Lytic cycle: phage replicates, host cell is destroyed. Lysogenic cycle: phage DNA integrates into host genome (prophage), host cell survives and replicates with prophage; can switch to lytic cycle."

      "type": "critical-thinking",
      "text": "In terms of evolution, which do you think arises first? The virus or the host? Explain your answer.",
      "answer": "The host likely arose first. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they require a living host cell to replicate. They lack the machinery for self-replication and metabolism. Therefore, host cells must have existed before viruses could emerge and utilize them. There are several hypotheses for viral origins (e.g., escape hypothesis, reduction hypothesis, virus-first hypothesis), but the dependence of all known viruses on cellular life strongly suggests hosts preceded viruses.",
      "explanation": "Hosts likely evolved first. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and depend on host cellular machinery for replication. This dependency implies that host cells must have existed before viruses could utilize them."

      "answer": "Yes, it is possible to synthesize viruses in the lab, and this has been done (e.g., poliovirus was synthesized from its known genetic sequence). To create a new virus, a 'mad scientist' might: 1. Design or obtain a viral genome (DNA or RNA) encoding essential viral proteins (capsid, replication enzymes, etc.). This could be done by synthesizing a known sequence, modifying an existing viral genome, or even attempting to create a novel sequence. 2. Introduce this genetic material into susceptible host cells. This could be done via transfection or by packaging the genome into viral particles if components are available. 3. If the genetic material is functional and the host cell provides necessary factors, the cell's machinery would be hijacked to produce viral components, which would then assemble into new virions. Ethical considerations and safety (biosafety levels) are paramount in such research.",
      "explanation": "Yes, viruses can be synthesized in a lab if their genetic sequence is known and can be introduced into host cells. This involves creating the viral nucleic acid and getting it into a host cell that can replicate it and produce viral proteins for assembly. This is a complex process with significant ethical and safety implications."

      "text": "Bacteriophages have lytic and lysogenic cycles. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for the phage.",
      "answer": "Lytic Cycle: Advantage - Rapid multiplication and release of many progeny phages, leading to quick spread if susceptible hosts are abundant. Disadvantage - Kills the host cell, so if hosts are scarce, the phage may not find a new host and could die out. Lysogenic Cycle: Advantage - Allows the phage to persist in a dormant state (prophage) within the host genome, replicating along with the host without killing it. This is beneficial when host cells are scarce or under stress. The prophage can confer new properties to the host (lysogenic conversion). Disadvantage - Slower replication compared to the lytic cycle, as it relies on host cell division. The phage does not immediately produce new infectious particles.",
      "explanation": "Lytic: Advantage - rapid replication, many progeny. Disadvantage - kills host, needs abundant hosts. Lysogenic: Advantage - phage survives in dormant state when hosts are scarce, replicates with host, can confer new traits to host. Disadvantage - slower, no immediate new phage production."

      "type": "critical-thinking",
      "text": "How does reverse transcriptase aid a retrovirus in establishing a chronic infection?",
      "answer": "Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that transcribes the retroviral RNA genome into a DNA copy (provirus). This proviral DNA can then integrate into the host cell's chromosome. Once integrated, the provirus becomes a permanent part of the host's genetic material. It is replicated along with the host cell's DNA during cell division and can remain latent or be transcribed to produce new viral particles over a long period. This stable integration and potential for long-term, low-level viral production or latency contributes to the establishment of a chronic infection.",
      "explanation": "Reverse transcriptase converts the viral RNA genome into DNA. This DNA copy (provirus) can then integrate into the host cell's chromosome, becoming a permanent part of the host's genome. This allows the virus to persist, replicate with the host cell, and potentially produce virus particles over a long period, leading to chronic infection."

Mechanical transmission: Via wounds caused by handling, tools, or natural abrasion, allowing sap from an infected plant to contact a healthy one. 2. Vectors: Insects (e.g., aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers), nematodes, fungi, or mites can carry viruses from one plant to another while feeding. 3. Vegetative propagation: Using infected plant parts (cuttings, grafts, tubers) to grow new plants. 4. Seed transmission: Some viruses can be transmitted through infected seeds. 5. Pollen transmission: Some viruses can be transmitted via infected pollen.",

      "answer": "Similarities include: 1. Replication: Both replicate themselves – biological viruses hijack host cells, computer viruses make copies of their code. 2. Host dependence: Both require a host system (biological cell or computer system) to function and replicate. 3. Transmission: Both can spread from one host to another (e.g., biological viruses via aerosols or contact, computer viruses via networks or infected media). 4. Harmful effects: Both can cause damage to their host system (disease in organisms, data corruption or system malfunction in computers). 5. Specificity: Some biological viruses are host-specific; some computer viruses target specific operating systems or applications. 6. Dormancy/Latency: Both can remain dormant for a period before becoming active.",
      "explanation": "Similarities include: self-replication, host dependency, modes of transmission, potential to cause harm/damage to the host system, and the ability to remain dormant or latent."

      "text": "Does a prion replicate? Explain.",
      "answer": "A prion does not replicate in the same way that viruses or cellular organisms do (i.e., by synthesizing new copies of its own genetic material). Instead, a prion (PrPSc), which is an abnormally folded protein, propagates by inducing normal cellular prion proteins (PrPC) to misfold into the abnormal PrPSc conformation. This conversion process is like a chain reaction: the newly formed PrPSc can then convert more PrPC molecules. So, it's a process of conformational change and templated misfolding, rather than replication of genetic material.",
      "explanation": "Prions do not replicate by synthesizing new genetic material. Instead, the abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) induces normal cellular prion proteins (PrPC) to misfold into the abnormal PrPSc form. This is a conformational conversion process, not true replication."
