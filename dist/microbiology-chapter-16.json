      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "During an epidemic, why might the prevalence of a disease at a particular time not be equal to the sum of the incidences of the disease?",
      "answer": "Prevalence is the total number of existing cases at a specific point in time, while incidence is the number of new cases over a period of time. The sum of incidences over time would represent all cases that have occurred. However, prevalence at a particular time might be lower than this sum because individuals may have recovered from the disease or died, and thus are no longer current active cases counted in prevalence. For chronic diseases, prevalence may be closer to the sum of incidences over a long period if few people recover or die quickly.",
      "explanation": "Prevalence counts active cases at a point in time. The sum of incidences includes all new cases over time. Prevalence is lower if individuals have recovered or died, as they are no longer active cases."

      "text": "What activity did John Snow conduct, other than mapping, that contemporary epidemiologists also use when trying to understand how to control a disease?",
      "answer": "Besides mapping cases, John Snow conducted interviews with affected individuals and their families to gather information about their habits and potential exposures (e.g., their water source). This systematic collection of case history data and hypothesis testing through observation and interviews is a fundamental activity in descriptive and analytical epidemiology used today to identify risk factors and modes of transmission.",
      "explanation": "John Snow interviewed residents to determine their water sources, linking cholera to specific contaminated water pumps. This case-finding, interviewing, and hypothesis testing based on exposure data is a core epidemiological practice."

      "id": 21,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "Differentiate between droplet vehicle transmission and airborne transmission.",
      "answer": "Droplet vehicle transmission involves the spread of pathogens via respiratory droplets (mucus particles >5 micrometers in diameter) expelled during coughing, sneezing, or talking. These droplets travel short distances (typically less than 1 meter) and do not remain suspended in the air for long. Airborne transmission involves pathogens carried on smaller droplet nuclei (<5 micrometers) or dust particles that can remain suspended in the air for extended periods and travel longer distances (greater than 1 meter).",
      "explanation": "Droplet transmission involves larger particles traveling short distances (<1m). Airborne transmission involves smaller particles (droplet nuclei) that can remain suspended in air and travel longer distances (>1m)."

      "text": "Why might an epidemiological population in a state not be the same size as the number of people in a state? Use an example.",
      "answer": "An epidemiological population refers to the group of individuals susceptible to a specific disease or condition being studied, not necessarily everyone residing in a geographical area. For example, if epidemiologists are studying the incidence of ovarian cancer in a state, the epidemiological population would only include individuals with ovaries (typically biological females), which is a subset of the total number of people in the state. Men and children without ovaries would not be part of this specific epidemiological population, even though they reside in the state.",
      "explanation": "An epidemiological population is defined by susceptibility to the condition under study. For example, a study on prostate cancer would only include individuals with a prostate gland as its epidemiological population, which is smaller than the total state population."

      "id": 23,
      "type": "critical-thinking",
      "text": "Many people find that they become ill with a cold after traveling by airplane. The air circulation systems of commercial aircraft use HEPA filters that should remove any infectious agents that pass through them. What are the possible reasons for increased incidence of colds after flights?",
      "answer": "Possible reasons include: 1. Close proximity to infected individuals: Airplanes confine many people in a small space for extended periods, increasing the chance of direct transmission (e.g., via droplets from coughing/sneezing) before air is filtered. 2. Contaminated surfaces (fomites): Tray tables, armrests, seatbelt buckles, and lavatory surfaces can be contaminated with respiratory viruses. 3. Stress of travel: Travel can be stressful, which can temporarily weaken the immune system. 4. Dry air: Cabin air is often very dry, which can dry out mucous membranes in the respiratory tract, making them more susceptible to infection. 5. Pre-existing exposure: Individuals might have been exposed before the flight, and the timing of symptom onset coincidentally aligns with post-flight. 6. HEPA filter limitations: While effective, HEPA filters might not capture 100% of particles immediately, or air circulation patterns might not be perfectly efficient in all parts of the cabin.",
      "explanation": "Reasons include close proximity to infected passengers (droplet transmission), contaminated surfaces, stress, dry cabin air impairing mucous membranes, and coincidental timing of pre-existing exposure. HEPA filters are effective but don't eliminate all transmission risks immediately."

      "id": 24,
      "type": "critical-thinking",
      "text": "An Atlantic crossing by boat from England to New England took 60â€“80 days in the 18th century. In the late 19th century the voyage took less than a week. How do you think these time differences for travel might have impacted the spread of infectious diseases from Europe to the Americas, or vice versa?",
      "answer": "Longer travel times (60-80 days): For acute infections with short incubation and illness periods (e.g., measles, smallpox), individuals might complete the entire disease cycle (incubate, become ill, and either recover or die) during the voyage. This could mean fewer actively infectious people arriving at the destination, potentially limiting initial spread. However, if many were infected, the ship could become a concentrated outbreak zone, and survivors could still introduce the disease. Shorter travel times (less than a week): Individuals infected shortly before or during the voyage would be more likely to arrive at their destination while still in the incubation period or early stages of illness, thus being actively infectious upon arrival. This could facilitate more rapid and widespread transmission of diseases into new populations. The shorter travel time increases the likelihood of an infected person arriving while still contagious, potentially leading to faster and broader outbreaks.",
      "explanation": "Longer voyages: Individuals might recover or die en route, potentially reducing the number of infectious arrivals for acute diseases. Shorter voyages: Higher likelihood of infected individuals arriving while still contagious, facilitating faster spread of diseases to new populations."
