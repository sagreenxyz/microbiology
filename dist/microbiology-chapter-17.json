      "answer": "In response to infection/inflammation, endothelial cells lining blood vessels upregulate adhesion molecules (selectins, integrin ligands like ICAMs). Circulating leukocytes (e.g., neutrophils) first loosely tether and roll along the endothelium via selectin interactions. Chemokines then activate the leukocytes, causing firm adhesion mediated by integrins binding to ICAMs. Finally, the leukocyte changes shape and squeezes between endothelial cells to exit the bloodstream and enter the infected tissue; this process is called transendothelial migration or diapedesis.",

      "text": "Neutrophils can sometimes kill human cells along with pathogens when they release the toxic contents of their granules into the surrounding tissue. Likewise, natural killer cells target human cells for destruction. Explain why it is advantageous for the immune system to have cells that can kill human cells as well as pathogens.",
      "answer": "It is advantageous because some pathogens are intracellular, meaning they hide and replicate inside human cells (e.g., viruses, some bacteria). To eliminate these infections, the immune system must be able to identify and destroy the infected host cells, thereby preventing further pathogen replication and spread. Natural killer (NK) cells target and kill host cells that are virally infected or cancerous by recognizing abnormal surface protein expression (e.g., lack of MHC I). Neutrophils, while primarily targeting extracellular pathogens, can cause collateral damage to nearby host cells when releasing potent antimicrobial substances, which can be necessary to clear a heavy infection in tissues, even if it means some host cell damage that can later be repaired.",
      "explanation": "Killing infected or abnormal host cells is crucial for eliminating intracellular pathogens (like viruses) or cancerous cells that would otherwise allow pathogens to replicate or tumors to grow. This prevents the spread of infection or cancer."

      "answer": "Assuming Figure 17.13 shows a typical differential white blood cell count, neutrophils would be expected in the highest numbers in a healthy patient. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of leukocyte, typically comprising 50-70% of the total white blood cell count.",
      "explanation": "Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell (leukocyte) in a healthy individual's bloodstream, typically making up 50-70% of the total."

      "text": "If a gram-negative bacterial infection reaches the bloodstream, large quantities of LPS can be released into the blood, resulting in a syndrome called septic shock. Death due to septic shock is a real danger. The overwhelming immune and inflammatory responses that occur with septic shock can cause a perilous drop in blood pressure; intravascular blood clotting; development of thrombi and emboli that block blood vessels, leading to tissue death; failure of multiple organs; and death of the patient. Identify and characterize two to three therapies that might be useful in stopping the dangerous events and outcomes of septic shock once it has begun, given what you have learned about inflammation and innate immunity in this chapter.",
      "answer": "1. Anti-inflammatory agents: Since septic shock involves an overwhelming inflammatory response (cytokine storm), therapies aimed at dampening this response could be beneficial. This might include corticosteroids (though their use is debated and context-dependent) or specific cytokine inhibitors (e.g., anti-TNF-α antibodies) to reduce the production or effects of pro-inflammatory mediators. 2. Anticoagulants: Intravascular clotting (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation - DIC) is a major complication. Anticoagulants like heparin could help prevent the formation of thrombi and emboli, thereby maintaining blood flow to vital organs. 3. Therapies to neutralize LPS: Experimental therapies have explored ways to neutralize LPS (endotoxin) directly, such as using antibodies against LPS or molecules that bind and sequester LPS, to prevent it from triggering the massive immune activation. (Note: Supportive care like fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to manage blood pressure, and antibiotics to kill the bacteria, are also critical but focus here is on inflammation/innate immunity aspects).",
      "explanation": "Therapies could include: 1. Anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, cytokine inhibitors) to reduce the cytokine storm. 2. Anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation. 3. Agents to neutralize LPS (endotoxin) to reduce the initial trigger of the massive immune response."

      "text": "In Lubeck, Germany, in 1930, a group of 251 infants was accidentally administered a tainted vaccine for tuberculosis that contained live Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This vaccine was administered orally, directly exposing the infants to the deadly bacterium. Many of these infants contracted tuberculosis, and some died. However, 44 of the infants never contracted tuberculosis. Based on your knowledge of the innate immune system, what innate defenses might have inhibited M. tuberculosis enough to prevent these infants from contracting the disease?",
      "answer": "Several innate defenses might have played a role: 1. Gastric acidity: The low pH of the stomach could have killed a significant portion of the ingested M. tuberculosis. 2. Mucosal barriers: The mucus layer lining the gastrointestinal tract could have trapped bacteria, and peristalsis could have helped eliminate them. Antimicrobial peptides (e.g., defensins) secreted by epithelial cells in the gut could also have killed bacteria. 3. Phagocytosis by macrophages: Macrophages in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) or lamina propria could have phagocytosed and killed some of the bacteria before they established infection. The efficiency of these macrophages might vary among individuals. 4. Normal microbiota: A robust and healthy gut microbiota could have outcompeted M. tuberculosis for nutrients or produced substances inhibitory to its growth. 5. Genetic differences: Individual variations in the genes controlling innate immune responses (e.g., PRR expression, cytokine production) could have led to a more effective early clearance in some infants.",
      "explanation": "Innate defenses that might have prevented infection include: gastric acidity killing bacteria, mucosal barriers (mucus, antimicrobial peptides), phagocytosis by macrophages in the gut, competition from normal gut microbiota, and individual genetic variations in innate immune responses."
