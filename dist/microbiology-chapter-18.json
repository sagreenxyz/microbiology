Haptens can only elicit an immune response if they are attached to a larger carrier molecule (like a protein).",

      "answer": "Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a mechanism where an effector cell of the immune system (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, eosinophils, macrophages) actively lyses a target cell whose surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies. The effector cell has Fc receptors that bind to the Fc region of the antibodies coating the target cell. This binding triggers the effector cell to release cytotoxic substances (like perforins and granzymes from NK cells) that kill the antibody-coated target cell.",
      "explanation": "ADCC occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on a target cell. Effector cells (like NK cells) then bind to the Fc region of these antibodies via Fc receptors, triggering the release of cytotoxic substances that kill the target cell."

Their primary effector function is to 'help' or coordinate the immune response by releasing cytokines that activate other immune cells, including B cells (for antibody production), cytotoxic T cells, and macrophages. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), once activated, directly recognize and kill host cells that are infected with intracellular pathogens (like viruses) or are cancerous, by releasing perforins and granzymes.",

      "answer": "Activation of helper T cells (CD4+) requires: 1. T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to an antigen peptide presented on an MHC II molecule of an antigen-presenting cell (APC). 2. Co-stimulatory signals, such as CD28 on the T cell binding to B7 (CD80/CD86) on the APC. \nActivation of cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) typically requires: 1. TCR binding to an antigen peptide presented on an MHC I molecule of an APC (often a dendritic cell that has also been activated by a helper T cell). 2. Co-stimulatory signals. 3. Cytokines (like IL-2) often provided by activated helper T cells. \nFor effector function, an activated cytotoxic T cell's TCR binds to antigen presented on MHC I of a target cell (e.g., virus-infected cell), leading to target cell killing.",
      "explanation": "Helper T cell activation: TCR/CD4 binds antigen-MHC II on APC, plus co-stimulation (e.g., CD28-B7). Cytotoxic T cell activation: TCR/CD8 binds antigen-MHC I on APC, co-stimulation, and often help from helper T cells (cytokines). Effector CTLs kill target cells presenting antigen on MHC I."

      "text": "Briefly compare the pros and cons of inactivated versus live attenuated vaccines.",
      "answer": "Inactivated vaccines: \nPros: Safer (cannot cause disease as the pathogen is killed), more stable (easier storage/transport). \nCons: Less immunogenic (often require multiple doses and adjuvants), primarily induce humoral (antibody) immunity, weaker cell-mediated immunity. \n\nLive attenuated vaccines: \nPros: More immunogenic (mimic natural infection, often single dose provides long-lasting immunity), induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immunity. \nCons: Risk of reversion to virulence (can cause disease in immunocompromised individuals), less stable (often require refrigeration).",
      "explanation": "Inactivated vaccines: Pros - safer, more stable. Cons - less immunogenic, may need boosters, weaker cell-mediated response. Live attenuated vaccines: Pros - highly immunogenic, strong cell-mediated and humoral response, often lifelong immunity. Cons - risk of reversion to virulence, less stable."

      "text": "Which mechanism of antigen presentation would be used to present antigens from a cell infected with a virus?",
      "answer": "Antigens from a virus-infected cell (intracellular pathogen) would be presented via MHC I molecules. Viral proteins synthesized within the infected host cell are processed by proteasomes in the cytoplasm. The resulting peptides are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they bind to MHC I molecules. These MHC I-peptide complexes are then transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.",
      "explanation": "Viral antigens, being intracellular, are processed in the cytoplasm and presented on MHC I molecules to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells."

      "text": "Which pathway of antigen presentation would be used to present antigens from an extracellular bacterial infection?",
      "answer": "Antigens from an extracellular bacterial infection would be presented via MHC II molecules. Extracellular bacteria are typically phagocytosed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like macrophages or dendritic cells. The bacteria are broken down in phagolysosomes, and the resulting peptides bind to MHC II molecules within vesicles. These MHC II-peptide complexes are then transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD4+ helper T cells.",
      "explanation": "Extracellular bacterial antigens are taken up by APCs (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells) via phagocytosis, processed in phagolysosomes, and presented on MHC II molecules to CD4+ helper T cells."

      "text": "A patient lacks the ability to make functioning T cells because of a genetic disorder. Would this patient’s B cells be able to produce antibodies in response to an infection? Explain your answer.",
      "answer": "The patient's B cells would have a severely impaired ability to produce antibodies, especially for most pathogens. While B cells can respond to T-independent antigens (typically large polysaccharides with repetitive epitopes) without T cell help, most antigens are T-dependent (especially proteins). For T-dependent antigens, B cells require activation signals from helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) to proliferate, differentiate into plasma cells, undergo class switching (e.g., from IgM to IgG), and form memory B cells. Without functioning T cells, the response to T-dependent antigens would be minimal or absent, leading to a significant immunodeficiency.",
      "explanation": "B cell antibody production would be severely compromised. Most antigens are T-dependent, requiring helper T cell assistance for B cell activation, proliferation, class switching, and memory formation. While a limited response to T-independent antigens might occur, overall antibody production would be very poor."
