Preservation: Fermentation can extend the shelf life of food, preventing spoilage and allowing food to be stored for longer periods, especially before refrigeration. 2. Increased nutritional value: Microbes can synthesize vitamins (e.g., B vitamins) or break down complex compounds, making nutrients more bioavailable. 3. Detoxification: Fermentation can break down some naturally occurring toxins in food. 4. Improved digestibility: Microbes can predigest complex carbohydrates and proteins, making them easier for humans to digest. 5. Protection against pathogens: The beneficial microbes in fermented foods can outcompete harmful pathogens, and the acidic environment created by fermentation can inhibit pathogen growth.",

      "answer": "Evidence includes: 1. Practices like quarantining individuals with certain diseases (e.g., leprosy) suggest an understanding that illness could spread from person to person, even if the agent was unseen. 2. Writings from scholars like Marcus Terentius Varro (1st century BC) who proposed that 'minute creatures, invisible to the eye, float in the air and cause serious diseases.' 3. Rituals and practices aimed at purification or warding off 'evil spirits' or 'bad air' (miasma) associated with disease, implying a belief in unseen harmful entities. 4. The development of sanitation practices in some ancient cultures (e.g., Roman aqueducts and sewers) suggests an awareness of a link between cleanliness and disease prevention, possibly related to unseen contaminants.",

      "text": "Why is using binomial nomenclature more useful than using common names?",
      "answer": "Binomial nomenclature (genus and species) provides a standardized, universal system for naming organisms. Common names can vary by language, region, and even among individuals, leading to confusion. A single scientific name ensures that scientists worldwide are referring to the exact same organism, facilitating clear communication and accurate record-keeping. Common names can also be misleading (e.g., a jellyfish isn't a fish).",

      "text": "Contrast the behavior of a virus outside versus inside a cell.",
      "answer": "Outside a cell, a virus is an inert particle (virion). It has no metabolism, cannot replicate, and does not exhibit characteristics of life. It is essentially a package of genetic material (DNA or RNA) within a protein coat (capsid), sometimes with an outer envelope. Inside a host cell, the virus becomes active. It hijacks the host cell's machinery (ribosomes, enzymes, ATP) to replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins. These components then assemble into new virions, which are eventually released from the host cell, often causing cell damage or death.",
      "explanation": "Outside a cell, a virus is inert and non-living, unable to replicate or metabolize. Inside a host cell, it uses the cell's machinery to replicate itself, effectively 'coming alive' through the host."
