      "text": "Although both type I and type II hypersensitivities involve antibodies as immune effectors, different mechanisms are involved with these different hypersensitivities. Differentiate the two.",
      "answer": "Type I hypersensitivity (allergy/anaphylaxis) is mediated by IgE antibodies. Initial exposure (sensitization) leads to IgE production, which binds to Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils. Upon re-exposure, the allergen cross-links these IgE molecules, triggering degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators (histamine, leukotrienes). The antigens are typically soluble allergens.\nType II hypersensitivity (cytotoxic) is mediated by IgG or IgM antibodies that bind to antigens on cell surfaces or in the extracellular matrix. This binding leads to cell destruction via complement activation (e.g., MAC formation), opsonization and phagocytosis, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antigens are cell-bound or matrix-associated.",
      "explanation": "Type I: IgE-mediated, mast cell degranulation upon allergen re-exposure, soluble antigens. Type II: IgG/IgM-mediated, antibodies bind to cell surface/matrix antigens leading to cell lysis/phagocytosis/ADCC."

      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "What types of antibodies are most common in type III hypersensitivities, and why?",
      "answer": "IgG antibodies are most common in type III hypersensitivities. This is because IgG is the most abundant antibody isotype in serum and is readily produced during secondary immune responses. When there is an excess of soluble antigen, IgG antibodies form small immune complexes (antigen-antibody aggregates) that are not efficiently cleared by phagocytes. These small complexes can deposit in tissues (e.g., blood vessel walls, kidney glomeruli, joints), where they activate complement, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. IgM can also form immune complexes, but IgG complexes are more frequently implicated due to their size and persistence.",
      "explanation": "IgG is most common because it's abundant and forms small, persistent immune complexes with soluble antigens that deposit in tissues, activating complement and causing inflammation."

      "id": 30,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "Why is a parent usually a better match for transplanted tissue to a donor than a random individual of the same species?",
      "answer": "A parent is usually a better match because Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes (called HLA genes in humans), which encode the primary antigens responsible for transplant rejection, are inherited from both parents. An individual inherits one set of HLA alleles from their mother and one set from their father (haplotypes). Therefore, a child will share at least one HLA haplotype (half of their HLA antigens) with each parent. While not a perfect match (unless the parents happen to share HLA types, which is rare), this 50% match is generally much closer than a match with a random, unrelated individual, reducing the likelihood and severity of rejection.",
      "explanation": "Individuals inherit one set of MHC/HLA genes (a haplotype) from each parent. Thus, a parent and child will always share at least one haplotype (a 50% match), which is generally better than a match with an unrelated individual."

      "answer": "Primary immunodeficiencies are genetic and often require lifelong management. Treatments include: 1. Replacement therapy (e.g., immunoglobulin infusions for antibody deficiencies, enzyme replacement). 2. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) or other severe defects. 3. Gene therapy (experimental for some conditions). 4. Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections.\nSecondary immunodeficiencies are acquired. Treatment focuses on: 1. Addressing the underlying cause (e.g., antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, nutritional support for malnutrition, discontinuing immunosuppressive drugs if possible). 2. Managing and preventing infections (e.g., prophylactic antibiotics). 3. Supporting the immune system if possible (e.g., sometimes immunoglobulin therapy).",

      "id": 32,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "text": "How can tumor antigens be effectively targeted without inducing an autoimmune (anti-self) response?",
      "answer": "Effective targeting relies on identifying tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) or tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) that are either unique to cancer cells or significantly overexpressed compared to normal cells. Strategies include: 1. Targeting mutated self-proteins (neoantigens) that are truly foreign to the normal immune system. 2. Targeting oncofetal antigens that are expressed during fetal development but silenced in normal adult tissues. 3. Targeting antigens from oncogenic viruses (e.g., HPV E6/E7 proteins). 4. Using approaches that enhance the immune response specifically at the tumor site or that target regulatory mechanisms that suppress anti-tumor immunity (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors). The goal is to break tolerance to the tumor while maintaining tolerance to normal self-tissues, which is a significant challenge.",
      "explanation": "Targeting focuses on tumor-specific antigens (TSAs, e.g., neoantigens from mutations) or tumor-associated antigens (TAAs, e.g., overexpressed or oncofetal antigens) that are minimally expressed on normal cells. Strategies aim to direct the immune response specifically to these, or to overcome local tumor immunosuppression."

      "text": "Patients are frequently given instructions to avoid allergy medications for a period of time prior to allergy testing. Why would this be important?",
      "answer": "Allergy medications, particularly antihistamines, work by blocking the effects of histamine, a key mediator released by mast cells during an allergic reaction (type I hypersensitivity). Allergy testing (e.g., skin prick tests) relies on observing the local inflammatory response (wheal and flare) caused by histamine release when an allergen is introduced. If a patient is taking allergy medication, these drugs will suppress or prevent the histamine-mediated reaction, even if the patient is truly allergic to the tested substance. This would lead to false-negative results, making it difficult to accurately identify the patient's allergens.",
      "explanation": "Allergy medications (like antihistamines) block the inflammatory response that allergy tests aim to provoke. Taking them before testing can lead to false-negative results, as the medication would suppress the visible signs of an allergic reaction (e.g., wheal and flare in skin tests)."

      "text": "In some areas of the world, a tuberculosis vaccine known as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is used. It is not used in the United States. Every person who has received this vaccine and mounted a protective response will have a positive reaction in a tuberculin skin test. Why? What does this mean for the usefulness of this skin test in those countries where this vaccine is used?",
      "answer": "The BCG vaccine is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, which is closely related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the cause of TB). A protective immune response to BCG involves the development of cell-mediated immunity (T-cell response) against mycobacterial antigens. The tuberculin skin test (TST, or Mantoux test) works by injecting tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD), which contains antigens from M. tuberculosis. In individuals previously sensitized to mycobacterial antigens (either through BCG vaccination or actual M. tuberculosis infection), these T cells will recognize the PPD antigens and mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity (type IV) reaction, resulting in a positive skin test (induration).\n\nThis means that in countries where BCG vaccination is common, a positive TST is not a reliable indicator of active M. tuberculosis infection, as it cannot distinguish between immunity due to vaccination and immunity due to infection. Therefore, the specificity and positive predictive value of the TST for diagnosing TB infection are reduced in BCG-vaccinated populations. Other diagnostic methods, such as interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which are less affected by BCG vaccination status, or chest X-rays and sputum cultures, become more important for diagnosing active TB disease in these settings.",
      "explanation": "BCG vaccine sensitizes the immune system to mycobacterial antigens, similar to an actual TB infection. The tuberculin skin test detects this sensitization. Thus, BCG-vaccinated individuals will test positive, making the skin test less useful for diagnosing new TB infections in vaccinated populations, as it can't distinguish between vaccine-induced immunity and actual infection. Other tests like IGRAs are preferred."
