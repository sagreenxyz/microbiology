# Chapter 1: An Invisible World - Summary

## 1.1 What Our Ancestors Knew
*   Humans have long suspected the existence of invisible "somethings" that cause disease, even before microorganisms were discovered.
*   Historical practices like quarantining, food preservation (fermentation, salting, drying), and sanitation showed an empirical understanding of microbial control.
*   Fermentation for food and beverages (bread, cheese, wine, beer) has been practiced for thousands of years.
*   The concept of miasma (bad air) was a prevalent, though incorrect, theory for disease transmission.

## 1.2 A Systematic Approach
*   **Taxonomy:** The science of classifying, describing, naming, and identifying organisms.
*   **Carolus Linnaeus:** Developed the Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature (Genus species).
*   **Phylogenetic Trees:** Diagrams showing evolutionary relationships. Early trees were based on visible characteristics; modern trees use genetic and biochemical data (e.g., rRNA sequences by Carl Woese).
*   **Three Domains of Life:** Proposed by Woese and Fox based on rRNA sequences: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
*   **Nomenclature:** Scientific names are italicized or underlined; Genus is capitalized, species is lowercase.
*   **Bergey's Manuals:** Standard references for prokaryotic taxonomy and identification.

## 1.3 Types of Microorganisms
*   **Prokaryotes:** Organisms lacking a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
    *   **Bacteria:** Diverse group, cell walls typically contain peptidoglycan. Various shapes (coccus, bacillus, spirillum, etc.). Found in nearly every habitat. Some are pathogenic.
    *   **Archaea:** Also prokaryotic, but cell walls lack peptidoglycan. Often found in extreme environments (extremophiles). Genetically distinct from bacteria. Not known to be human pathogens.
*   **Eukaryotes:** Organisms with cells containing a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
    *   **Protists:**
        *   **Algae:** Plant-like protists, photosynthetic. Cell walls often made of cellulose. Can be unicellular or multicellular.
        *   **Protozoa:** Animal-like protists, diverse motility (pseudopods, flagella, cilia). Mostly unicellular. Some are parasitic.
    *   **Fungi:** Include yeasts (unicellular), molds (multicellular, filamentous), and mushrooms. Cell walls typically contain chitin. Not photosynthetic; are saprophytes or parasites. Some cause disease.
    *   **Helminths:** Multicellular parasitic worms (not strictly microorganisms, but their eggs and larvae are microscopic and relevant to microbiology).
*   **Acellular Infectious Agents:** Not considered living cells.
    *   **Viruses:** Obligate intracellular parasites consisting of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat (capsid). Require a host cell to replicate.
    *   **Prions:** Infectious protein particles that cause neurodegenerative diseases.
    *   **Viroids:** Small, circular RNA molecules that infect plants.
