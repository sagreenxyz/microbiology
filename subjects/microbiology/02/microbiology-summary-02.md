# Chapter 2: How We See the Invisible World - Summary

## 2.1 The Properties of Light
*   **Wavelength:** The distance between two consecutive peaks of a wave. Shorter wavelengths generally provide better resolution.
*   **Amplitude:** The height of a wave peak.
*   **Frequency:** The rate of vibration of a wave.
*   **Reflection:** Light bounces off a surface.
*   **Absorption:** Light is taken up by a material.
*   **Transmission:** Light passes through a material.
*   **Interference:** Light waves interact with each other.
*   **Diffraction:** Light waves bend or scatter as they pass through a small opening or around an obstacle.
*   **Refraction:** Light waves bend as they pass from one medium to another due to changes in speed. The refractive index measures how much a material slows light.
*   **Lenses:** Used in microscopy to focus light. Convex lenses converge light; concave lenses diverge light.
*   **Focal Point:** The point where a convex lens focuses light rays.
*   **Electromagnetic Spectrum:** Includes visible light, UV light, X-rays, etc. Different types of microscopy utilize different parts of this spectrum.

## 2.2 Peering Into the Invisible World
*   **Magnification:** The ability of a lens to enlarge the image of an object.
*   **Resolution (Resolving Power):** The ability to distinguish between two adjacent objects as separate. Limited by the wavelength of light and the numerical aperture of the lens. Shorter wavelengths and higher numerical apertures improve resolution.
*   **Contrast:** The difference in light intensity between an object and its background, making it easier to see. Staining improves contrast.
*   **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek:** Often credited as the first to observe microbes ("animalcules") using simple microscopes.
*   **Robert Hooke:** First to describe "cells" based on observations of cork.

## 2.3 Instruments of Microscopy
*   **Light Microscopy:**
    *   **Brightfield Microscope:** Most common type; produces a dark image on a bright background. Can be simple (one lens) or compound (multiple lenses).
    *   **Darkfield Microscope:** Produces a bright image on a dark background by using an opaque disk to block direct light. Useful for viewing live, unstained specimens.
    *   **Phase-Contrast Microscope:** Enhances contrast in unstained, live cells by using differences in refractive indices and light phase shifts.
    *   **Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscope:** Similar to phase-contrast but uses two beams of light and prisms to create a 3D-like image.
    *   **Fluorescence Microscope:** Uses fluorescent dyes (fluorochromes) that absorb UV or blue light and emit visible light at a longer wavelength. Used for identifying specific microbes or structures (immunofluorescence).
    *   **Confocal Microscope:** Uses a laser to scan multiple z-planes, producing a 3D image. Useful for thick specimens like biofilms.
    *   **Two-Photon Microscope:** Uses infrared light for deeper penetration into thick specimens with less phototoxicity.
*   **Electron Microscopy:** Uses a beam of electrons instead of light, providing much higher magnification and resolution.
    *   **Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM):** Electrons pass through an ultrathin specimen. Used to view internal structures. Requires extensive sample preparation (fixation, dehydration, embedding, sectioning).
    *   **Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM):** Electrons scan the surface of a specimen coated with metal, producing a 3D image of the surface.
*   **Scanning Probe Microscopy:**
    *   **Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM):** Measures current changes as a probe moves over a conductive surface. Can view atoms.
    *   **Atomic Force Microscope (AFM):** Uses a probe that physically interacts with the surface. Can be used for both conductive and non-conductive samples.

## 2.4 Staining Microscopic Specimens
*   **Purpose of Staining:** To increase contrast and visibility of microorganisms and their structures.
*   **Fixation:** Attaching cells to a slide, often kills the microbes and preserves their structures. Heat fixation or chemical fixation.
*   **Basic Dyes:** Have a positively charged chromophore; stain negatively charged cell components (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins). Examples: crystal violet, methylene blue, safranin.
*   **Acidic Dyes:** Have a negatively charged chromophore; repelled by negatively charged cell walls, so they stain the background (negative staining). Examples: nigrosin, India ink.
*   **Simple Staining:** Uses a single dye to highlight the entire microorganism.
*   **Differential Staining:** Uses multiple dyes to distinguish between different types of bacteria or structures.
    *   **Gram Stain:** Differentiates bacteria based on cell wall structure (Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative). Steps: crystal violet (primary stain), iodine (mordant), alcohol (decolorizer), safranin (counterstain). Gram-positive cells appear purple; Gram-negative cells appear pink/red.
    *   **Acid-Fast Stain:** Differentiates bacteria with waxy mycolic acids in their cell walls (e.g., *Mycobacterium*). Uses carbolfuchsin (primary stain), heat or detergent (mordant), acid-alcohol (decolorizer), methylene blue (counterstain). Acid-fast cells appear red; non-acid-fast cells appear blue.
*   **Special Stains:** Used to visualize specific structures.
    *   **Capsule Stain:** Negative staining technique to visualize capsules (unstained capsule against a stained background).
    *   **Endospore Stain (Schaeffer-Fulton method):** Uses malachite green (primary stain) with heat to penetrate endospores, then safranin (counterstain). Endospores appear green; vegetative cells appear pink/red.
    *   **Flagella Stain:** Uses a mordant to thicken flagella, making them visible.
