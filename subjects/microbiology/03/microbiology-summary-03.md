# Chapter 3: The Cell - Summary

## 3.1 Spontaneous Generation
*   **Spontaneous Generation Theory:** The historical belief that living organisms could arise from nonliving matter.
*   **Francesco Redi (17th century):** Conducted experiments with meat in jars, challenging spontaneous generation for larger organisms by showing maggots came from flies.
*   **John Needham (18th century):** Briefly revived support for spontaneous generation with experiments involving boiled broth that became cloudy.
*   **Lazzaro Spallanzani (18th century):** Argued Needham's results were due to contamination; his experiments with sealed, boiled broth showed no microbial growth.
*   **Louis Pasteur (19th century):** Conclusively disproved spontaneous generation with his swan-neck flask experiments, demonstrating that microbes in the air caused contamination. "Omne vivum ex vivo" (all life from life).

## 3.2 Foundations of Modern Cell Theory
*   **Robert Hooke (1665):** First to use the term "cells" after observing cork.
*   **Matthias Schleiden (1838):** Stated that all plants are made of cells.
*   **Theodor Schwann (1839):** Stated that all animals are made of cells.
*   **Rudolf Virchow (1855):** Stated that all cells arise from pre-existing cells ("omnis cellula e cellula").
*   **The Cell Theory (Modern):**
    1.  All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
    2.  The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
    3.  Cells arise from pre-existing cells.
*   **Endosymbiotic Theory:** Proposed by Lynn Margulis. Explains the origin of eukaryotic organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts as descendants of free-living prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell.
    *   **Evidence:** Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own circular DNA (similar to prokaryotes), 70S ribosomes, divide by binary fission, and have double membranes.

## 3.3 Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells
*   **General Morphology:**
    *   **Shapes:** Coccus (spherical), bacillus (rod), vibrio (curved rod), coccobacillus, spirillum (spiral), spirochete (long, flexible spiral).
    *   **Arrangements:** Diplo- (pairs), strepto- (chains), staphylo- (clusters), tetrads, sarcinae.
*   **Cell Wall:** Provides shape and protection from osmotic lysis.
    *   **Peptidoglycan:** Main component of bacterial cell walls (not found in Archaea).
    *   **Gram-positive:** Thick peptidoglycan layer, teichoic acids.
    *   **Gram-negative:** Thin peptidoglycan layer, outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Lipid A (endotoxin), O antigen. Periplasmic space.
    *   **Atypical cell walls:** *Mycobacterium* (mycolic acids), *Mycoplasma* (no cell wall).
*   **Glycocalyx:** Outer layer (capsule or slime layer). Aids in attachment, protection from desiccation and phagocytosis, biofilm formation.
*   **Appendages:**
    *   **Flagella:** For motility. Composed of filament, hook, and basal body. Different arrangements (monotrichous, amphitrichous, lophotrichous, peritrichous).
    *   **Fimbriae:** Short, bristle-like fibers for attachment.
    *   **Pili:** Longer than fimbriae. Sex pilus (F pilus) involved in conjugation (DNA transfer).
*   **Cytoplasmic Membrane (Plasma Membrane):** Phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. Selectively permeable, site of electron transport chain in many prokaryotes.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Gel-like substance containing cytosol, ribosomes, and genetic material.
*   **Nucleoid:** Region containing the single, circular chromosome (DNA). Not membrane-bound.
*   **Plasmids:** Small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules. Often carry genes for antibiotic resistance or virulence factors.
*   **Ribosomes:** Site of protein synthesis. 70S in prokaryotes (composed of 50S and 30S subunits).
*   **Inclusions:** Storage granules for nutrients (e.g., volutin, sulfur, glycogen, polyhydroxybutyrate). Gas vacuoles for buoyancy. Magnetosomes for orientation.
*   **Endospores:** Dormant, highly resistant structures produced by some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., *Bacillus*, *Clostridium*) during unfavorable conditions. Protect genetic material.

## 3.4 Unique Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells
*   **Nucleus:** Membrane-bound organelle containing multiple linear chromosomes (DNA).
*   **Cell Wall (if present):** Simpler than prokaryotic. Fungi (chitin), algae (cellulose, silica, agar, etc.), plants (cellulose). Protozoa and animal cells lack cell walls.
*   **Glycocalyx (if present):** External to cell wall or plasma membrane. For protection, adhesion, cell recognition.
*   **Plasma Membrane:** Phospholipid bilayer similar to prokaryotes, but contains sterols (e.g., cholesterol) for stability.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Region between plasma membrane and nuclear envelope.
*   **Cytoskeleton:** Network of protein filaments (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules) for shape, support, movement, and transport.
*   **Ribosomes:** 80S (composed of 60S and 40S subunits) in cytoplasm and on rough ER. 70S ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts.
*   **Membrane-Bound Organelles:**
    *   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** Network of tubules and sacs.
        *   **Rough ER (RER):** Studded with ribosomes; modifies and transports proteins.
        *   **Smooth ER (SER):** Lacks ribosomes; involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification, calcium storage.
    *   **Golgi Apparatus (Golgi Complex):** Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids from the ER for secretion or delivery to other organelles.
    *   **Lysosomes:** Contain digestive enzymes to break down waste materials and cellular debris.
    *   **Peroxisomes:** Contain enzymes for detoxification and metabolic processes (e.g., breakdown of fatty acids, amino acids).
    *   **Mitochondria:** Site of cellular respiration and ATP production ("powerhouses"). Double membrane, cristae, matrix.
    *   **Chloroplasts (in algae and plants):** Site of photosynthesis. Double membrane, thylakoids (stacked into grana), stroma.
    *   **Vacuoles:** Membrane-bound sacs for storage, transport, or maintaining turgor pressure.
*   **Flagella and Cilia (if present):** For motility or moving substances. More complex structure than prokaryotic flagella (9+2 arrangement of microtubules).
