# Chapter 4: Prokaryotic Diversity - Summary

## 4.1 Prokaryote Habitats, Relationships, and Microbiomes
*   **Ubiquity:** Prokaryotes are found in virtually every environment on Earth, including extreme conditions (temperature, pH, salinity, pressure).
*   **Microbial Ecology:** Study of interactions between microorganisms and their environment, and with each other.
*   **Symbiosis:** Close and long-term interaction between different biological species.
    *   **Mutualism:** Both species benefit (e.g., *Rhizobium* in plant roots).
    *   **Amensalism:** One species is harmed, the other is unaffected.
    *   **Commensalism:** One species benefits, the other is unaffected.
    *   **Neutralism:** Neither species is affected.
    *   **Parasitism:** One species (parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (host).
*   **Microbiome:** All microorganisms (and their collective genetic material) residing in a particular environment (e.g., human gut microbiome, soil microbiome).
*   **Human Microbiome:** Plays crucial roles in digestion, immunity, and overall health. Can be resident (permanent) or transient (temporary).

## 4.2 Proteobacteria (Phylum)
*   Largest and most diverse phylum of Gram-negative bacteria. Divided into five classes (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon).
*   **Alphaproteobacteria:**
    *   Often oligotrophs (grow in low nutrient environments).
    *   Includes nitrogen-fixing bacteria (*Rhizobium*), plant pathogens (*Agrobacterium*), and obligate intracellular pathogens (*Rickettsia*, *Chlamydia* - though *Chlamydia* is now in its own phylum).
*   **Betaproteobacteria:**
    *   Often eutrophs (require abundant organic nutrients).
    *   Includes human pathogens like *Neisseria* (gonorrhea, meningitis) and *Bordetella* (whooping cough).
*   **Gammaproteobacteria:**
    *   Largest and most diverse class of Proteobacteria.
    *   Includes many medically and scientifically important groups:
        *   *Pseudomonas* (opportunistic pathogens, metabolically diverse).
        *   Vibrionales (*Vibrio cholerae* - cholera).
        *   Enterobacteriaceae (enteric bacteria like *Escherichia coli*, *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, *Yersinia*).
        *   *Haemophilus* (respiratory infections).
        *   Purple sulfur bacteria (anoxygenic photosynthesis).
*   **Deltaproteobacteria:**
    *   Small class, includes sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs).
    *   *Bdellovibrio* (predatory bacteria).
    *   Myxobacteria (form multicellular fruiting bodies).
*   **Epsilonproteobacteria:**
    *   Smallest class, often microaerophilic.
    *   Includes *Campylobacter* (gastroenteritis) and *Helicobacter pylori* (stomach ulcers, gastritis).

## 4.3 Nonproteobacteria Gram-Negative Bacteria and Phototrophic Bacteria
*   **Spirochetes (Phylum):** Long, spiral-shaped, highly motile (axial filament). Includes *Treponema pallidum* (syphilis), *Borrelia burgdorferi* (Lyme disease).
*   **CFB Group (Phylum Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides):**
    *   *Cytophaga*: Gliding motility, degrade cellulose.
    *   *Flavobacterium*: Aquatic, some pathogenic to fish.
    *   *Bacteroides*: Obligate anaerobes, dominant in human gut, mostly mutualistic but can be opportunistic pathogens.
*   **Planctomycetes (Phylum):** Aquatic bacteria, reproduce by budding, some have internal membrane-bound compartments (anammoxosome).
*   **Phototrophic Bacteria:**
    *   **Cyanobacteria (Phylum):** Oxygenic photosynthesis (produce O2). Formerly "blue-green algae." Some fix nitrogen (heterocysts). Can form blooms.
    *   **Green Sulfur Bacteria & Green Nonsulfur Bacteria:** Anoxygenic photosynthesis.
    *   **Purple Sulfur Bacteria & Purple Nonsulfur Bacteria:** (Purple sulfur are Gammaproteobacteria). Anoxygenic photosynthesis.

## 4.4 Gram-Positive Bacteria (Phyla)
*   Characterized by thick peptidoglycan layer in cell wall.
*   **High G+C Gram-Positive Bacteria (Phylum Actinobacteria):**
    *   More than 50% guanine and cytosine in their DNA.
    *   Includes:
        *   *Actinomyces*: Filamentous, common in soil and oral cavity.
        *   *Mycobacterium*: Acid-fast, waxy mycolic acid layer (*M. tuberculosis*, *M. leprae*).
        *   *Corynebacterium*: (*C. diphtheriae* - diphtheria).
        *   *Bifidobacterium*: Common in human gut, probiotic.
        *   *Streptomyces*: Source of many antibiotics, filamentous, soil bacteria.
*   **Low G+C Gram-Positive Bacteria (Phylum Firmicutes):**
    *   Less than 50% guanine and cytosine in their DNA.
    *   Includes:
        *   Clostridiales:
            *   *Clostridium*: Obligate anaerobes, endospore-formers (*C. botulinum*, *C. tetani*, *C. perfringens*, *C. difficile*).
        *   Lactobacillales (Lactic Acid Bacteria): Ferment sugars to lactic acid.
            *   *Lactobacillus*, *Streptococcus* (many species, some pathogenic like *S. pyogenes*, *S. pneumoniae*), *Enterococcus*.
        *   Bacillales:
            *   *Bacillus*: Aerobes or facultative anaerobes, endospore-formers (*B. anthracis*, *B. cereus*).
            *   *Staphylococcus*: Facultative anaerobes, tolerate high salt (*S. aureus*, *S. epidermidis*).
        *   *Mycoplasma* (Class Mollicutes): Lack cell walls, pleomorphic. Smallest free-living cells. (*M. pneumoniae*).

## 4.5 Deeply Branching Bacteria
*   Represent early evolutionary branches of bacteria, close to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).
*   Many are thermophiles or hyperthermophiles.
*   Examples: *Aquifex*, *Thermotoga*, *Deinococcus radiodurans* (highly radiation-resistant).

## 4.6 Archaea (Domain)
*   Prokaryotic cells, distinct from Bacteria in cell wall composition (no peptidoglycan, may have pseudopeptidoglycan or S-layers), membrane lipids (ether linkages, branched chains), and rRNA sequences.
*   Many are extremophiles, but also found in diverse, moderate environments.
*   Not known to cause human disease.
*   Major Phyla:
    *   **Euryarchaeota:**
        *   **Methanogens:** Obligate anaerobes, produce methane (CH4). Found in anoxic sediments, digestive tracts.
        *   **Halophiles:** Require high salt concentrations (*Halobacterium*).
        *   Some thermophiles and acidophiles.
    *   **Crenarchaeota:**
        *   Mostly thermophiles and hyperthermophiles, many are sulfur-dependent.
        *   Found in hot springs, hydrothermal vents (*Sulfolobus*, *Thermoproteus*).
    *   Other proposed phyla like Korarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota.
