# Chapter 5: The Eukaryotes of Microbiology - Summary

## 5.1 Unicellular Eukaryotic Parasites (Protists)
*   **Protists:** A diverse group of mostly unicellular eukaryotes; not a formal taxonomic group but a convenience term.
*   **Protozoa:** Animal-like protists, heterotrophic, diverse motility. Many are parasitic.
    *   **Amoebozoa:** Move using pseudopods.
        *   *Entamoeba histolytica:* Causes amoebic dysentery.
        *   Slime molds (cellular and plasmodial types).
    *   **Excavata:** Often have a feeding groove ("excavation").
        *   **Fornicata:** Lack mitochondria (have mitosomes). *Giardia lamblia* (giardiasis).
        *   **Parabasalia:** Have parabasal bodies and kinetoplastids. *Trichomonas vaginalis* (trichomoniasis).
        *   **Euglenozoa:** Include euglenids (some photosynthetic) and kinetoplastids.
            *   Kinetoplastids: Have a kinetoplast (DNA mass in mitochondrion). *Trypanosoma* spp. (African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease), *Leishmania* spp. (leishmaniasis).
    *   **Chromalveolata:**
        *   **Alveolates:** Have alveoli (membrane-enclosed sacs beneath plasma membrane).
            *   **Apicomplexans:** Obligate intracellular parasites, apical complex for host cell penetration. *Plasmodium* spp. (malaria), *Toxoplasma gondii* (toxoplasmosis), *Cryptosporidium parvum* (cryptosporidiosis).
            *   **Ciliates:** Move using cilia. *Balantidium coli* (only ciliate human pathogen, causes dysentery). *Paramecium* is a common non-pathogenic example.
            *   **Dinoflagellates:** Many are photosynthetic, some cause harmful algal blooms (red tides).
        *   **Stramenopiles:** Include water molds (Oomycetes), diatoms, brown algae.
            *   Oomycetes: Fungus-like, but cell walls of cellulose. *Phytophthora infestans* (potato late blight).
*   **Life Cycles:** Protozoan life cycles can be complex, often involving multiple hosts or stages (e.g., trophozoite - active feeding stage; cyst - dormant, resistant stage).

## 5.2 Parasitic Helminths
*   Multicellular eukaryotic worms, but their eggs and larvae are often microscopic and relevant to microbiology.
*   Two major groups:
    *   **Nematoda (Roundworms):**
        *   Unsegmented, cylindrical body.
        *   Complete digestive system.
        *   Examples: *Ascaris lumbricoides* (ascariasis), *Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworm), *Necator americanus* (hookworm), *Trichinella spiralis* (trichinosis).
    *   **Platyhelminthes (Flatworms):**
        *   Dorsoventrally flattened body.
        *   **Trematodes (Flukes):** Non-segmented, leaf-shaped. Often have complex life cycles with multiple hosts. Oral and ventral suckers.
            *   Examples: *Schistosoma* spp. (schistosomiasis), *Fasciola hepatica* (liver fluke).
        *   **Cestodes (Tapeworms):** Segmented body (proglottids). Lack a digestive system; absorb nutrients. Scolex (head) for attachment.
            *   Examples: *Taenia* spp. (beef and pork tapeworms), *Diphyllobothrium latum* (fish tapeworm).
*   **Diagnosis:** Often involves microscopic examination of feces, urine, blood, or tissue for eggs, larvae, or adult worms.

## 5.3 Fungi
*   Eukaryotic, heterotrophic organisms. Most are multicellular (molds), some are unicellular (yeasts).
*   **Cell Walls:** Composed primarily of chitin.
*   **Morphology:**
    *   **Yeasts:** Unicellular, typically reproduce by budding.
    *   **Molds:** Multicellular, composed of filamentous hyphae. A mass of hyphae is a mycelium.
        *   Septate hyphae: Have cross-walls (septa).
        *   Coenocytic (aseptate) hyphae: Lack septa.
    *   **Dimorphic Fungi:** Can exist as either yeast or mold form, depending on environmental conditions (e.g., temperature). Many pathogenic fungi are dimorphic.
*   **Reproduction:**
    *   **Asexual:** Spores (conidiospores, sporangiospores), budding, fragmentation.
    *   **Sexual:** Involves plasmogamy (fusion of cytoplasm), karyogamy (fusion of nuclei), and meiosis to produce sexual spores (e.g., zygospores, ascospores, basidiospores).
*   **Major Phyla (based on sexual reproduction):**
    *   **Zygomycota:** Produce zygospores. Coenocytic hyphae. Example: *Rhizopus stolonifer* (bread mold).
    *   **Ascomycota (Sac Fungi):** Produce ascospores in a sac-like ascus. Septate hyphae. Includes yeasts (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*), molds (*Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*), morels, truffles. Many plant and human pathogens.
    *   **Basidiomycota (Club Fungi):** Produce basidiospores on club-shaped basidia. Septate hyphae. Includes mushrooms, puffballs, rusts, smuts.
    *   **Microsporidia:** Obligate intracellular parasites, once classified as protists.
*   **Importance:** Decomposers, food production (bread, cheese, beer, wine), antibiotic production (*Penicillium*), research tools.
*   **Mycoses:** Fungal diseases. Can be superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous, or systemic. Opportunistic mycoses are common in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., *Candida albicans*, *Aspergillus* spp.).

## 5.4 Algae
*   Mostly aquatic, photosynthetic eukaryotes. Lack true roots, stems, or leaves.
*   **Cell Walls:** Vary, often cellulose, silica, agar, carrageenan.
*   **Pigments:** Chlorophylls, carotenoids, phycobilins.
*   **Diversity:**
    *   **Chlorophyta (Green Algae):** Ancestors of land plants. Store starch.
    *   **Chromalveolata:**
        *   **Dinoflagellates:** Unicellular, often have two flagella. Some produce toxins (harmful algal blooms, red tides). Some are bioluminescent.
        *   **Diatoms (Bacillariophyta):** Unicellular, silica cell walls (frustules). Major component of phytoplankton.
        *   **Phaeophyta (Brown Algae):** Multicellular (e.g., kelp).
    *   **Rhodophyta (Red Algae):** Mostly multicellular. Source of agar and carrageenan.
*   **Importance:** Major oxygen producers, base of aquatic food webs, source of food and industrial products (agar, alginate, carrageenan).
*   **Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs):** Overgrowth of certain algae (often dinoflagellates or cyanobacteria) that can produce toxins harmful to marine life and humans.

## 5.5 Lichens
*   Composite organisms resulting from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus (mycobiont, usually an Ascomycete) and a photosynthetic partner (photobiont, either a green alga or a cyanobacterium).
*   **Mutualistic Relationship:** Fungus provides structure, protection, and absorbs water/minerals. Photobiont provides carbohydrates through photosynthesis.
*   **Morphology (Thallus Types):**
    *   **Crustose:** Flat, crust-like, tightly attached to substrate.
    *   **Foliose:** Leaf-like, lobed.
    *   **Fruticose:** Shrub-like, branched.
*   **Importance:** Pioneer organisms (colonize bare rock), food source for some animals, produce unique biochemical compounds, indicators of air pollution.
