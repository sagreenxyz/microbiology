# Chapter 6: Acellular Pathogens - Summary

## 6.1 Viruses
*   **General Characteristics:**
    *   Acellular (not cells), obligate intracellular parasites.
    *   Consist of genetic material (DNA or RNA, single or double-stranded) enclosed in a protein coat (capsid).
    *   Lack metabolic machinery, ribosomes, and most enzymes for protein synthesis and ATP generation; rely on host cell.
    *   Vary in size (typically 20-900 nm).
*   **Host Range and Specificity:** Viruses can infect all types of life forms (animals, plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, archaea). Host range is usually specific due to viral attachment sites and host cell factors.
*   **Viral Structure:**
    *   **Genome:** DNA or RNA, single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), linear or circular.
    *   **Capsid:** Protein coat surrounding the genome. Composed of protein subunits called capsomeres.
        *   **Helical:** Rod-shaped capsomeres form a helix around the nucleic acid.
        *   **Polyhedral (Icosahedral):** Many-sided, most common is icosahedron (20 triangular faces).
        *   **Complex:** Complicated structures, e.g., bacteriophages with a polyhedral head, helical sheath, and tail fibers.
    *   **Envelope (some viruses):** Lipid bilayer derived from host cell membrane, surrounds the capsid. May have viral glycoproteins (spikes) for attachment.
        *   Enveloped viruses are generally more susceptible to disinfectants.
        *   Non-enveloped (naked) viruses lack an envelope.
*   **Classification of Viruses:** Based on genomics (type of nucleic acid, strandedness), strategy for replication, morphology, presence/absence of envelope. (e.g., Baltimore classification system).

## 6.2 The Viral Life Cycle
*   **General Steps for Animal Viruses:**
    1.  **Attachment (Adsorption):** Virus attaches to specific receptors on the host cell surface.
    2.  **Penetration:** Virus or its genome enters the host cell.
        *   Enveloped viruses: Membrane fusion or endocytosis.
        *   Non-enveloped viruses: Typically endocytosis.
    3.  **Uncoating:** Viral nucleic acid is released from the capsid.
    4.  **Biosynthesis (Replication):** Viral genome is replicated, and viral proteins are synthesized using host cell machinery. Strategy varies depending on viral genome type (DNA vs. RNA, ss vs. ds).
    5.  **Assembly (Maturation):** New viral particles are assembled.
    6.  **Release:** Newly formed virions are released from the host cell.
        *   Enveloped viruses: Budding (acquires envelope from host membrane).
        *   Non-enveloped viruses: Lysis of the host cell.
*   **Bacteriophage Life Cycles:** Viruses that infect bacteria.
    *   **Lytic Cycle:** Phage replicates and lyses the host cell, releasing new phages.
        1.  Attachment
        2.  Penetration (injects genome)
        3.  Biosynthesis
        4.  Maturation
        5.  Lysis
    *   **Lysogenic Cycle:** Phage DNA integrates into the host bacterium's chromosome, becoming a prophage. The host cell (lysogen) replicates the prophage along with its own DNA.
        *   Prophage can confer new properties to the host (lysogenic conversion, e.g., toxin production).
        *   Induction: Prophage can excise from the host chromosome and enter the lytic cycle.
*   **Plant Viruses:** Similar life cycle to animal viruses but have specific mechanisms for entering plant cells (e.g., through wounds, insect vectors).
*   **Viral Growth Curve:** Typically shows an eclipse period (no detectable virions), then a burst (rapid increase in virions). Burst size = number of virions released per infected cell.

## 6.3 Isolation, Culture, and Identification of Viruses
*   **Cultivation of Viruses:** Requires living host cells.
    *   **Bacteriophages:** Cultured in bacterial lawns (broth or agar). Plaques (clearings in the lawn) indicate phage lysis.
    *   **Animal Viruses:**
        *   **Living Animals:** Used for some viruses or to study immune responses.
        *   **Embryonated Eggs:** Different viral types replicate in specific parts of the egg.
        *   **Cell Cultures (Tissue Cultures):** Preferred method. Cells grown in vitro.
            *   Primary cell lines: Derived directly from tissues, limited lifespan.
            *   Continuous cell lines (immortalized): Can be propagated indefinitely (often derived from cancer cells).
            *   Cytopathic effects (CPEs): Visible changes in infected cells (e.g., rounding, lysis, syncytia formation).
*   **Detection and Identification of Viruses:**
    *   **Cytopathic Effects (CPEs):** Microscopic observation of changes in host cells.
    *   **Hemagglutination Assay:** Some viruses agglutinate (clump) red blood cells.
    *   **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs):** PCR, RT-PCR to detect viral genetic material.
    *   **Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs) / ELISA:** Detect viral antigens or antibodies against viruses.
    *   **Serological Tests:** Detect antibodies in patient serum.

## 6.4 Viroids, Virusoids, and Prions
*   **Viroids:**
    *   Small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules.
    *   Do not code for proteins; disrupt host plant cell metabolism.
    *   Cause plant diseases (e.g., potato spindle tuber viroid).
*   **Virusoids:**
    *   Subviral particles; small, circular ssRNAs.
    *   Require a "helper" virus for replication and packaging.
    *   Essentially non-self-replicating ssRNAs packaged into the capsid of a helper virus.
    *   Primarily infect plants.
*   **Prions (Proteinaceous Infectious Particles):**
    *   Infectious agents composed solely of protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup> - abnormal, misfolded form of a normal host protein PrP<sup>C</sup>).
    *   PrP<sup>Sc</sup> induces conformational change in PrP<sup>C</sup>, converting it to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, leading to accumulation and neurodegeneration.
    *   Cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) - fatal neurodegenerative diseases.
        *   In humans: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia.
        *   In animals: Scrapie (sheep), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease"), chronic wasting disease (deer, elk).
    *   Extremely resistant to heat, radiation, and common disinfectants.
