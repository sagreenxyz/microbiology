# Chapter 7: Microbial Biochemistry - Summary

## 7.1 Organic Molecules
*   **Organic Molecules:** Contain carbon and hydrogen atoms; form the basis of life.
*   **Carbon's Versatility:** Can form four covalent bonds, leading to diverse and complex structures (chains, branches, rings).
*   **Functional Groups:** Specific groups of atoms within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, carbonyl, sulfhydryl).
*   **Isomers:** Molecules with the same chemical formula but different structural arrangements.
    *   **Structural Isomers:** Differ in covalent arrangement of atoms.
    *   **Stereoisomers:** Same covalent bonds but differ in spatial arrangement.
        *   **Enantiomers:** Non-superimposable mirror images (e.g., D- and L-forms of amino acids or sugars).
*   **Macromolecules:** Large organic molecules (polymers) built from smaller repeating units (monomers). Formed by dehydration synthesis (water removed) and broken down by hydrolysis (water added).

## 7.2 Carbohydrates
*   **Composition:** (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>; primarily carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
*   **Functions:** Energy source, energy storage, structural components, cell recognition.
*   **Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars):**
    *   Monomers of carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose, ribose, deoxyribose).
    *   Classified by number of carbons (triose, tetrose, pentose, hexose).
*   **Disaccharides:**
    *   Two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond (formed by dehydration synthesis).
    *   Examples: Sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), maltose (glucose + glucose).
*   **Polysaccharides:**
    *   Long chains of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds.
    *   **Starch:** Energy storage in plants (amylose, amylopectin).
    *   **Glycogen:** Energy storage in animals and bacteria.
    *   **Cellulose:** Structural component of plant cell walls; polymer of glucose with β-1,4 glycosidic bonds.
    *   **Chitin:** Structural component of fungal cell walls and arthropod exoskeletons; polymer of N-acetylglucosamine.
    *   **Peptidoglycan:** Structural component of bacterial cell walls.

## 7.3 Lipids
*   Diverse group of hydrophobic organic molecules.
*   **Functions:** Energy storage, structural components of membranes, insulation, hormones, pigments.
*   **Fatty Acids:** Long hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group.
    *   **Saturated:** No double bonds in hydrocarbon chain.
    *   **Unsaturated:** One or more double bonds (mono- or polyunsaturated).
*   **Triglycerides (Fats and Oils):**
    *   Glycerol molecule esterified to three fatty acids.
    *   Primary energy storage lipids.
*   **Phospholipids:**
    *   Glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate group (often with an additional polar head group).
    *   Amphipathic: Hydrophilic head, hydrophobic tails.
    *   Major component of cell membranes (form bilayers).
*   **Steroids:**
    *   Four fused carbon rings.
    *   Example: Cholesterol (component of animal cell membranes, precursor for steroid hormones). Ergosterol in fungal membranes.
*   **Waxes:** Long-chain fatty acid esterified to a long-chain alcohol. Water-resistant. (e.g., mycolic acids in *Mycobacterium*).

## 7.4 Proteins
*   Polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
*   **Functions:** Enzymes, structural components, transport, regulation, defense, movement.
*   **Amino Acids:**
    *   Monomers of proteins. 20 common types.
    *   Structure: Central carbon (α-carbon) bonded to an amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>), a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a variable R group (side chain).
    *   R group determines the chemical properties of the amino acid.
*   **Peptide Bonds:** Formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another by dehydration synthesis.
*   **Levels of Protein Structure:**
    *   **Primary Structure:** Linear sequence of amino acids. Determined by genes.
    *   **Secondary Structure:** Localized folding of the polypeptide chain into α-helices or β-pleated sheets, stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
    *   **Tertiary Structure:** Overall 3D shape of a single polypeptide chain, determined by interactions between R groups (hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges).
    *   **Quaternary Structure:** Arrangement of two or more polypeptide subunits to form a functional protein.
*   **Denaturation:** Loss of protein structure (secondary, tertiary, quaternary) and function due to heat, pH changes, chemicals. Primary structure may remain intact.

## 7.5 Using Biochemistry to Identify Microorganisms
*   Biochemical tests are widely used to identify bacteria and yeasts based on their metabolic capabilities.
*   **Carbohydrate Fermentation Tests:** Detect acid and/or gas production from fermentation of specific carbohydrates. Often use pH indicators and Durham tubes.
*   **Enzyme Tests:** Detect the presence of specific enzymes (e.g., catalase, oxidase, urease, coagulase).
*   **IMViC Tests:** (Indole, Methyl Red, Voges-Proskauer, Citrate) - a set of tests used to differentiate enteric bacteria.
*   **Analytical Profile Index (API) Strips:** Miniaturized, multi-test systems containing dehydrated media for numerous biochemical tests.
*   **Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS):** Identifies microorganisms by analyzing their unique protein profiles (mass spectrum). Rapid and accurate.
*   **Proteomic Analysis:** Study of all proteins (proteome) expressed by an organism under specific conditions.
*   **Lipid Profile Analysis (FAME/PLFA):** Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) analysis or Phospholipid-derived Fatty Acid (PLFA) analysis can create profiles to identify microbes.
