# Chapter 8: Microbial Metabolism - Summary

## 8.1 Energy, Matter, and Enzymes
*   **Metabolism:** The sum of all chemical reactions within a cell, categorized into anabolism (synthesis, requires energy) and catabolism (breakdown, releases energy).
*   **Energy Currency:** ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of the cell.
*   **Electron Carriers:** Molecules like NAD+, NADP+, and FAD accept and donate high-energy electrons (e.g., NADH, NADPH, FADH2).
*   **Enzymes:** Biological catalysts (usually proteins) that speed up biochemical reactions by lowering activation energy. They are specific to their substrates.
*   **Enzyme Structure & Function:** Enzymes have an active site where substrates bind. Factors like temperature, pH, and substrate concentration affect enzyme activity.
*   **Enzyme Regulation:** Includes competitive inhibitors (bind to active site) and noncompetitive (allosteric) inhibitors (bind to an allosteric site, changing active site shape). Feedback inhibition is a common regulatory mechanism.

## 8.2 Catabolism of Carbohydrates
*   **Glycolysis:** The breakdown of one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules, with a net production of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. Occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen.
*   **Transition Reaction (Pyruvate Oxidation):** Each pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA, producing 1 NADH and releasing 1 CO2 per pyruvate. Links glycolysis to the Krebs cycle.
*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle or Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle):** Each acetyl-CoA is oxidized, generating (per acetyl-CoA) 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, 1 ATP (or GTP), and releasing 2 CO2. Occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotes.
*   **Oxidative Phosphorylation:**
    *   **Electron Transport Chain (ETC):** A series of membrane-bound protein complexes that transfer electrons from NADH and FADH2 to a final electron acceptor. Energy released is used to pump protons (H+) across a membrane, creating a proton motive force (PMF).
    *   **Chemiosmosis:** The PMF drives protons back across the membrane through ATP synthase, which synthesizes ATP.
*   **Aerobic Respiration:** Uses oxygen as the final electron acceptor in the ETC. Yields a high amount of ATP.
*   **Anaerobic Respiration:** Uses an inorganic molecule other than oxygen (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, carbonate) as the final electron acceptor. Yields less ATP than aerobic respiration but more than fermentation.
*   **Fermentation:** An anaerobic process that uses an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor to regenerate NAD+ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue. Does not involve an ETC or Krebs cycle. Produces significantly less ATP (only from glycolysis). Common end products include lactic acid and ethanol.

## 8.3 Other Catabolic Pathways
*   **Lipid Catabolism:**
    *   Triglycerides are broken down by lipases into glycerol and fatty acids.
    *   Glycerol can be converted to an intermediate of glycolysis.
    *   Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation, producing acetyl-CoA (which enters the Krebs cycle), NADH, and FADH2.
*   **Protein Catabolism:**
    *   Proteins are broken down by proteases into amino acids.
    *   Amino acids are deaminated (amino group removed).
    *   The remaining carbon skeletons can enter glycolysis, the transition reaction, or the Krebs cycle at various points.

## 8.4 Photosynthesis
*   The process by which phototrophic organisms convert light energy into chemical energy (stored in ATP and NADPH, then in organic molecules).
*   **Light-Dependent Reactions:**
    *   Occur in photosynthetic membranes (e.g., thylakoids).
    *   Light energy is absorbed by pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, phycocyanins).
    *   Water is split (in oxygenic photosynthesis), releasing O2, electrons, and protons.
    *   ATP is generated via photophosphorylation (similar to oxidative phosphorylation, using an ETC and ATP synthase).
    *   NADPH is produced.
*   **Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin-Benson Cycle):**
    *   Occur in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes or stroma of chloroplasts in eukaryotes.
    *   ATP and NADPH from light-dependent reactions are used to fix CO2 into organic molecules (e.g., glucose).
*   **Anoxygenic Photosynthesis:** Does not produce oxygen; uses electron donors other than water (e.g., H2S).

## 8.5 Biogeochemical Cycles
*   Microorganisms are essential for the cycling of elements (carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, etc.) through ecosystems.
*   **Carbon Cycle:** Involves CO2 fixation by autotrophs (photosynthesis, chemosynthesis) and release by heterotrophs (respiration, fermentation) and decomposers.
*   **Nitrogen Cycle:**
    *   **Nitrogen Fixation:** Conversion of atmospheric N2 to ammonia (NH3) by certain bacteria (e.g., Rhizobium, cyanobacteria).
    *   **Ammonification:** Decomposition of organic nitrogen to NH4+.
    *   **Nitrification:** Oxidation of NH4+ to nitrite (NO2-) and then to nitrate (NO3-) by nitrifying bacteria.
    *   **Denitrification:** Reduction of NO3- to N2 gas by denitrifying bacteria, returning nitrogen to the atmosphere.
*   **Sulfur Cycle:** Involves the oxidation and reduction of sulfur compounds by various microbes.
*   **Phosphorus Cycle:** Involves the transformation of phosphorus between inorganic and organic forms, primarily through rocks, soil, water, and living organisms.
*   Other cycles like iron and manganese cycles also involve microbial activities.
