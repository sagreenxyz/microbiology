      "answer": "It is important to measure light transmission through a control tube with only broth (a 'blank') to calibrate the spectrophotometer and account for any absorbance or scattering of light caused by the medium itself. This ensures that the turbidity measurement accurately reflects the bacterial cell density, not the properties of the broth.",
      "explanation": "The control tube (blank) sets a baseline (zero absorbance or 100% transmittance) for the spectrophotometer, accounting for the turbidity of the medium itself. This ensures that subsequent readings measure only the turbidity due to bacterial growth."

      "answer": "Maintaining a proton motive force (PMF) across the cell membrane is particularly challenging at high pH (alkaline conditions). The PMF relies on a higher concentration of protons (H+) outside the cell than inside. In a high pH environment, the external proton concentration is very low, making it difficult to establish and maintain this gradient, which is crucial for ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation and for other processes like flagellar rotation and active transport.",

      "answer": "Possible reasons for initial treatment failure: 1. Biofilm formation: S. epidermidis is notorious for forming biofilms on medical devices like catheters. Bacteria within a biofilm are often more resistant to antibiotics due to the protective EPS matrix, reduced antibiotic penetration, altered metabolic states of bacteria within the biofilm, and presence of persister cells. The IV antibiotic might not have effectively eradicated the biofilm on the catheter. 2. Persister cells: Even if susceptible, some bacteria within the population (especially in a biofilm) might have been persister cells, which are metabolically dormant and less susceptible to antibiotics that target active processes. Once antibiotic pressure was removed, these could regrow.\n\nReasons for second treatment success: 1. Removal of the nidus of infection: Removing the catheter eliminated the primary site of biofilm formation and the reservoir of infection. 2. Different route of administration/different antibiotic properties: Oral antibiotics might have different pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, tissue penetration) that were more effective, or perhaps a different class of antibiotic was used (though the question implies susceptibility was known for the first). However, the key factor was likely catheter removal. 3. Host immune response: With the biofilm source removed, the host's immune system, aided by the oral antibiotics, could more effectively clear the remaining planktonic bacteria.",
      "explanation": "The catheter likely harbored a biofilm of S. epidermidis, which is inherently more resistant to antibiotics. Removing the catheter removed the biofilm source, allowing the second course of antibiotics (oral) to be effective against remaining planktonic bacteria, aided by the host's immune system."

      "answer": "Autoinducers need to be small molecules for several reasons: 1. Diffusion: They must be able to readily diffuse out of the bacterial cell that produces them and into the surrounding environment to signal other cells. 2. Cell permeability: They also need to diffuse back into other bacterial cells (or interact with surface receptors) to trigger a response. Small size facilitates passage across cell membranes or interaction with receptors. 3. Specificity and Cost: Synthesizing large, complex signaling molecules would be energetically more expensive for the bacteria. Small molecules can still achieve specificity through their unique chemical structures and interaction with specific receptors.",

      "answer": "Assuming Figure B1 is a standard MPN table for a 3-tube dilution series (e.g., 3 tubes each of 10mL, 1mL, and 0.1mL inocula): A result of 3 positive tubes in the first dilution (e.g., 10 mL), 2 positive in the second (e.g., 1 mL), and 1 positive in the third (e.g., 0.1 mL) would correspond to a specific value in the MPN table. For example, using a common MPN table, the combination 3-2-1 often gives an MPN index of 150. If the middle dilution was 1 mL, this would mean 150 bacteria per 100 mL. The exact value depends on the specific MPN table being referenced in Appendix B.",
      "explanation": "The MPN (Most Probable Number) is determined by looking up the pattern of positive tubes (3-2-1 in this case, representing the number of positive tubes in each dilution series) in a statistical table (like Appendix B1).

      "answer": "At very high cell concentrations (typical of stationary phase): 1. Multiple scattering events: Light passing through the dense culture is scattered multiple times by different cells. This can lead to some scattered light still reaching the detector, underestimating the true cell density. 2. Saturation of detector: The spectrophotometer's detector may become saturated or respond non-linearly when the amount of light transmitted is very low (i.e., absorbance is very high). 3. Cell characteristics change: In stationary phase, cells may change in size, shape, or start to lyse, which can affect how they scatter light, independent of actual cell number changes. The relationship between turbidity and cell number is most linear during the log phase.",
      "explanation": "At high cell densities, the relationship between turbidity and cell number becomes non-linear. This is due to factors like multiple scattering of light by cells, cells shielding each other from the light beam, and potential changes in cell size or shape in stationary phase. The spectrophotometer may also reach its limit of detection."

Both cultures are known facultative anaerobes. Give a likely reason for success of the gram-negative rod. Assume that the cultures have comparable intrinsic growth rates.",
      "answer": "Given that both are facultative anaerobes and incubation was without aeration, oxygen would become limited. Possible reasons for the gram-negative rod's success: 1. More efficient anaerobic respiration/fermentation: The gram-negative rod might be more efficient at anaerobic respiration (if alternative electron acceptors were present in the medium) or fermentation than the gram-positive coccus, allowing it to outcompete for limited resources under anaerobic conditions. 2. Production of inhibitory substances: The gram-negative rod might produce waste products or specific inhibitory substances (e.g., bacteriocins) that are more detrimental to the gram-positive coccus under these conditions. 3. Motility advantage: While motility is less of an advantage in a well-mixed broth, if there were any microgradients of nutrients or oxygen, the motile gram-negative rod might have had a slight advantage in accessing them, though this is less likely to be the primary reason in a static flask culture if nutrients are initially uniform.",
