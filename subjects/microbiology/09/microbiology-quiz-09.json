    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "text": "Which of the following pigments are especially useful at great depths, where less light penetrates?",
      "options": [
        "carotenoids and chlorophylls",
        "fucoxanthin and carotenoids",
        "fucoxanthin and phycobilins",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "text": "Which enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species are present or absent in obligate anaerobes and aerotolerant organisms?",
      "options": [
        "catalases",
        "superoxide dismutases",
        "peroxidases",
        "all of these"
      ],
      "answer": "all of these",
      "explanation": "Obligate anaerobes typically lack catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Aerotolerant anaerobes usually have superoxide dismutase and may have peroxidase, but typically lack catalase. The presence or absence of these enzymes dictates their ability to survive in oxygen."

      "id": 5,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "text": "If you grow two species of bacteria on mannitol salt agar to determine which can ferment mannitol, and you know both species can grow on the medium, which type of medium is the agar?",

        "differential",
        "selective",
        "both a differential medium and a selective medium"
      ],
      "answer": "differential",
      "explanation": "Mannitol salt agar is both selective (high salt inhibits non-halophiles) and differential (mannitol fermentation changes pH indicator). If both species grow, the selective aspect is met by both. The ability to distinguish between them based on mannitol fermentation makes it differential in this context."

      ],
      "answer": "When facultative anaerobes and obligate anaerobes coexist, the facultative anaerobes use up any oxygen present, which allows the obligate anaerobes to thrive.",
