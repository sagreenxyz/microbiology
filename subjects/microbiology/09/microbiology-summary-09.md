# Chapter 9: Microbial Growth - Summary

## 9.1 How Microbes Grow
*   **Microbial Growth:** Increase in the number of cells, not cell size.
*   **Binary Fission:** Primary method of reproduction in bacteria.
    1.  Cell elongates, DNA is replicated.
    2.  Cell wall and plasma membrane begin to constrict (septum formation, involving FtsZ protein).
    3.  Cross-wall forms, completely separating the two DNA copies.
    4.  Cells separate into two identical daughter cells.
*   **Generation Time (Doubling Time):** Time required for a cell to divide (or a population to double). Varies among organisms and with environmental conditions.
*   **Calculating Population Size:** N<sub>n</sub> = N<sub>0</sub> * 2<sup>n</sup> (where N<sub>n</sub> is the number of cells after n generations, N<sub>0</sub> is the initial number of cells, and n is the number of generations).

## 9.2 The Growth Curve
*   Batch culture (closed system) typically shows four phases:
    1.  **Lag Phase:** Intense metabolic activity preparing for growth, but no increase in population. Cells adapt to new medium.
    2.  **Log (Exponential) Phase:** Cells divide at a constant rate (exponential growth). Most active metabolically and most sensitive to adverse conditions (e.g., antibiotics).
    3.  **Stationary Phase:** Growth rate slows; number of microbial deaths balances number of new cells. Nutrients become limited, waste products accumulate.
    4.  **Death (Decline) Phase:** Number of deaths exceeds number of new cells. Population decreases exponentially. Some cells may form endospores or persister cells.

## 9.3 Sustaining Microbial Growth
*   **Continuous Culture:** Used to maintain growth in the log phase.
    *   **Chemostat:** A device that adds fresh medium and removes waste/old cells at a constant rate, maintaining a specific growth rate and cell density.
    *   **Turbidostat:** Similar to chemostat but regulates flow rate to maintain a constant turbidity (cell density).

## 9.4 Counting Bacteria
*   **Direct Methods:** Count individual cells.
    *   **Direct Microscopic Count:** Uses a specialized slide (e.g., Petroff-Hausser chamber, hemocytometer). Counts both live and dead cells. Quick but can be inaccurate for motile or dilute samples.
    *   **Plate Count (Viable Count):** Counts only live, culturable cells.
        *   **Serial Dilution:** Sample is diluted to obtain countable plates (typically 30-300 colonies).
        *   **Pour Plate Method:** Sample mixed with molten agar and poured into a plate. Colonies grow on and within the agar.
        *   **Spread Plate Method:** Sample spread onto the surface of solidified agar. Colonies grow only on the surface.
        *   Results expressed as Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) per mL or gram.
    *   **Most Probable Number (MPN):** Statistical estimation method based on growth in multiple tubes of broth from serial dilutions. Used for samples where bacteria don't grow well on solid media.
    *   **Filtration:** For dilute samples. Water passed through a filter; filter placed on agar medium. Colonies counted.
*   **Indirect Methods:** Estimate population size based on other indicators.
    *   **Turbidity:** Cloudiness of a liquid culture measured by a spectrophotometer (measures absorbance or optical density). More cells = higher turbidity. Quick but doesn't distinguish live/dead cells.
    *   **Metabolic Activity:** Measures consumption of a substrate or production of a metabolic product (e.g., CO2, acid).
    *   **Dry Weight:** Cells are filtered, dried, and weighed. Useful for filamentous organisms.

## 9.5 Biofilms: Microbial Communities
*   **Biofilms:** Complex, structured communities of microorganisms encased in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, adhering to a surface.
*   **Formation:**
    1.  Attachment of planktonic (free-floating) cells to a surface.
    2.  Colonization and cell-to-cell signaling (quorum sensing).
    3.  Production of EPS (hydrated matrix of polysaccharides, proteins, DNA, lipids).
    4.  Maturation into a complex, 3D structure with channels for nutrient and waste transport.
    5.  Dispersion of cells to colonize new sites.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Heterogeneous environment with different microhabitats.
    *   Increased resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants (EPS barrier, altered microbial physiology).
    *   Protection from host immune responses and environmental stresses.
*   **Quorum Sensing:** Cell-to-cell communication within biofilms. Microbes produce and release autoinducers (signaling molecules). When autoinducer concentration reaches a threshold, it triggers coordinated gene expression (e.g., EPS production, virulence factor expression).
*   **Significance:**
    *   Medical: Infections on catheters, implants, teeth (plaque), chronic infections (e.g., cystic fibrosis).
    *   Industrial: Pipe clogging, corrosion, bioremediation.
    *   Environmental: Nutrient cycling.

## 9.6 Environmental Factors Affecting Growth
*   **Oxygen Requirements:**
    *   **Obligate Aerobes:** Require oxygen for growth (use aerobic respiration).
    *   **Facultative Anaerobes:** Can grow with or without oxygen; prefer oxygen (can switch between aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation).
    *   **Obligate Anaerobes:** Cannot tolerate oxygen; killed by it (use anaerobic respiration or fermentation). Lack enzymes like catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) to neutralize toxic oxygen radicals.
    *   **Aerotolerant Anaerobes:** Do not use oxygen for growth but can tolerate it (have SOD, usually lack catalase). Use fermentation.
    *   **Microaerophiles:** Require oxygen at low concentrations (lower than atmospheric).
    *   **Culturing Anaerobes:** Requires special media (e.g., thioglycollate broth with oxygen indicator like resazurin) and equipment (anaerobic jars, anaerobic chambers).
*   **pH:**
    *   **Neutrophiles:** Grow best at neutral pH (6.5-7.5). Most bacteria.
    *   **Acidophiles:** Grow best at acidic pH (below 5.5).
    *   **Alkaliphiles:** Grow best at alkaline pH (above 8.0).
*   **Temperature:**
    *   Microbes have minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperatures.
    *   **Psychrophiles:** Cold-loving (0-15°C).
    *   **Psychrotrophs:** Grow at 0°C but optimum is 20-30°C (important in food spoilage).
    *   **Mesophiles:** Moderate-temperature-loving (20-45°C). Most human pathogens.
    *   **Thermophiles:** Heat-loving (50-80°C).
    *   **Hyperthermophiles:** Extreme heat-loving (above 80°C). Often Archaea.
*   **Osmotic Pressure:**
    *   **Halophiles:** Require high salt concentrations for growth (e.g., *Halobacterium*).
    *   **Halotolerant (Osmotolerant):** Can tolerate high salt concentrations but do not require them (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*).
*   **Other Factors:** Hydrostatic pressure (barophiles), radiation.

## 9.7 Culture Media
*   **Culture Medium (Media):** Nutrient material prepared for microbial growth in the laboratory.
*   **Sterile:** Must be free of all living microorganisms before inoculation.
*   **Inoculum:** Microbes introduced into a medium.
*   **Culture:** Microbes growing in/on a culture medium.
*   **Types of Media:**
    *   **Chemically Defined Medium:** Exact chemical composition is known.
    *   **Complex Medium:** Exact chemical composition varies (e.g., uses extracts from yeasts, meat, plants like nutrient broth/agar).
    *   **Selective Medium:** Suppresses growth of unwanted microbes and encourages growth of desired microbes (e.g., MacConkey agar for Gram-negative bacteria).
    *   **Differential Medium:** Makes it easier to distinguish colonies of different microbes (e.g., blood agar for hemolysis, MacConkey agar for lactose fermentation).
    *   **Enrichment Medium:** Provides nutrients and conditions favoring growth of a particular microbe present in low numbers (enrichment culture).
    *   **Reducing Media:** Contain ingredients (e.g., thioglycollate) that chemically combine with dissolved oxygen to create an anaerobic environment.
*   **Agar:** Complex polysaccharide derived from algae, used as a solidifying agent in media. Not metabolized by most microbes. Melts at ~100°C, solidifies at ~40°C.
