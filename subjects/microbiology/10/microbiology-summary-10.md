# Chapter 10: Biochemistry of the Genome - Summary

## 10.1 Discovering the Secrets of DNA
*   **Early Beliefs:** Proteins were initially favored as the genetic material due to their complexity.
*   **Frederick Griffith (1928):** Demonstrated transformation in *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. Showed that genetic material from dead pathogenic bacteria (S strain) could transform live non-pathogenic bacteria (R strain) into pathogenic ones.
*   **Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944):** Identified DNA as the transforming principle by showing that DNA-degrading enzymes (DNases), but not protein-degrading enzymes (proteases), eliminated transformation.
*   **Hershey and Chase (1952):** Used bacteriophages labeled with radioactive sulfur (<sup>35</sup>S for protein) or phosphorus (<sup>32</sup>P for DNA). Showed that DNA, not protein, entered the bacterial cell during infection and directed phage replication, confirming DNA as the genetic material.
*   **Erwin Chargaff (Chargaff's Rules):** Found that in DNA, the amount of adenine (A) equals thymine (T), and guanine (G) equals cytosine (C). (A+G = T+C).
*   **Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins:** Used X-ray diffraction to study DNA structure, revealing its helical nature and dimensions.
*   **James Watson and Francis Crick (1953):** Proposed the double helix model of DNA structure, incorporating Chargaff's rules and Franklin's X-ray data.

## 10.2 DNA Structure and Function
*   **Nucleic Acids:** Polymers of nucleotides. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).
*   **Nucleotides:** Composed of:
    1.  A pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA).
    2.  A phosphate group.
    3.  A nitrogenous base.
*   **Nitrogenous Bases:**
    *   **Purines:** Adenine (A), Guanine (G) (double-ring structure).
    *   **Pyrimidines:** Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) (in DNA), Uracil (U) (in RNA) (single-ring structure).
*   **DNA Structure:**
    *   **Double Helix:** Two antiparallel strands coiled around each other.
    *   **Sugar-Phosphate Backbone:** Deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups linked by phosphodiester bonds.
    *   **Complementary Base Pairing:** Adenine pairs with Thymine (A-T) via two hydrogen bonds. Guanine pairs with Cytosine (G-C) via three hydrogen bonds.
    *   **Antiparallel Strands:** One strand runs 5' to 3', the other runs 3' to 5'. (5' end has a free phosphate group; 3' end has a free hydroxyl group on the sugar).
*   **Function of DNA:** Stores the genetic information that determines an organism's traits and directs protein synthesis.

## 10.3 RNA Structure and Function
*   **RNA Structure:**
    *   Usually single-stranded (can form secondary structures like hairpins by base pairing with itself).
    *   Ribose as the pentose sugar.
    *   Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T); U pairs with A.
*   **Types of RNA and their Functions:**
    *   **Messenger RNA (mRNA):** Carries genetic information transcribed from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis. Codons (three-nucleotide sequences) on mRNA specify amino acids.
    *   **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA):** A major structural and catalytic component of ribosomes (the site of protein synthesis).
    *   **Transfer RNA (tRNA):** Transports specific amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Has an anticodon that base-pairs with an mRNA codon, and an amino acid attachment site.
    *   **Other RNAs:** MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), involved in gene regulation. Ribozymes (catalytic RNA molecules).

## 10.4 Chromosomes
*   **Chromosome:** Structure containing DNA that carries hereditary information in the form of genes.
*   **Genome:** The complete set of genetic information in an organism (all chromosomes and plasmids).
*   **Gene:** A segment of DNA (or RNA in some viruses) that codes for a functional product, usually a protein or an RNA molecule.
*   **Prokaryotic Chromosomes:**
    *   Typically a single, circular chromosome located in the nucleoid region.
    *   May also contain plasmids (small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA).
    *   DNA is supercoiled and associated with DNA-binding proteins (not histones like eukaryotes, though some archaea have histone-like proteins).
*   **Eukaryotic Chromosomes:**
    *   Multiple, linear chromosomes located within the nucleus.
    *   DNA is complexed with histone proteins to form chromatin.
        *   **Nucleosome:** Basic unit of chromatin; DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins.
    *   Chromatin condenses significantly during cell division.
    *   May also have extrachromosomal DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts (circular, similar to prokaryotic DNA).
*   **Genotype:** The genetic makeup of an organism (the collection of genes).
*   **Phenotype:** The observable characteristics of an organism, resulting from the interaction of its genotype and the environment.
*   **Noncoding DNA:** Regions of DNA that do not code for proteins. Can have regulatory functions, code for functional RNA molecules, or be of unknown function.
