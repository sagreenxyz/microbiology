      "answer": "is read by ribosomes during the process of translation",
      "explanation": "DNA serves as the genetic material, its sequence provides instructions for mRNA synthesis (transcription), and it aims to remain constant (though mutations can occur). However, mRNA, not DNA, is read by ribosomes during translation."

      "answer": "to facilitate splicing",
      "explanation": "The 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail protect mRNA from degradation, aid in its export from the nucleus, and help in ribosome binding for translation. Splicing (removal of introns) occurs before the poly-A tail is fully formed and is guided by sequences within the pre-mRNA itself, though the cap can be involved in recruiting splicing factors."

      ],
      "answer": "A site",
      "explanation": "An incoming charged tRNA (aminoacyl-tRNA) binds to the A (aminoacyl) site of the ribosome during elongation. The P (peptidyl) site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain, and the E (exit) site is where uncharged tRNAs leave."
    },

      ],
      "answer": "the polypeptide is released",
      "explanation": "A nonsense (stop) codon signals the termination of translation. Release factors bind to the A site, causing the hydrolysis of the bond between the polypeptide and the tRNA in the P site, leading to the release of the polypeptide."

        "deletion of one nucleotide"
      ],
      "answer": "deletion of one nucleotide",
      "explanation": "A frameshift mutation is caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame of the codons downstream of the mutation. Deletion of a whole codon removes an amino acid but doesn't shift the frame."

      "answer": "It is used to identify mutants with restored biosynthetic activity.",
      "explanation": "The Ames test uses an auxotrophic strain of bacteria (e.g., Salmonella requiring histidine) to detect mutagens. A mutagen will cause reversions, allowing the bacteria to grow on a medium lacking histidine, thus identifying mutants with restored biosynthetic activity (revertants)."

This is because gene expression can vary due to epigenetic modifications, different environmental conditions, or developmental stages, leading to different phenotypes (observable characteristics) even with identical genetic material. For example, different cell types in a multicellular organism have the same genotype but vastly different phenotypes due to differential gene expression.",

      "answer": "Purpose in eukaryotes: RNA processing (5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and splicing) modifies pre-mRNA into mature mRNA. This increases mRNA stability, facilitates its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, helps in ribosome recognition for translation, and removes non-coding introns. Prokaryotes: They do not require similar extensive processing because: 1. They lack a nucleus, so transcription and translation can be coupled. 2. Their genes are generally not interrupted by introns. 3. Their mRNA is typically less stable and has a shorter lifespan.",

      "answer": "Translation terminates because stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) do not code for any amino acid and are not recognized by tRNAs. Instead, release factors (proteins) recognize the stop codon in the A site of the ribosome. Binding of release factors triggers the hydrolysis of the bond between the completed polypeptide chain and the tRNA in the P site, releasing the polypeptide. The ribosomal subunits, mRNA, and release factors then dissociate.",
      "explanation": "Stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs. When a release factor binds to the A site at a stop codon, it promotes the hydrolysis of the polypeptide from the tRNA in the P site, leading to termination and disassembly of the translation complex."

You notice that the colony morphology is strikingly different on plates of minimal media with glucose compared to that seen on trypticase soy agar plates. How can you explain these differences in colony morphology?",
      "answer": "Colony morphology can be influenced by nutrient availability and growth rate. Trypticase soy agar (TSA) is a rich, complex medium providing abundant amino acids, vitamins, and other growth factors. Minimal media with glucose provides only essential salts and glucose as a carbon/energy source, requiring the bacterium to synthesize all its cellular components. On TSA, rapid growth and production of extracellular substances (like capsules or slime layers) might lead to larger, more mucoid, or differently pigmented colonies. On minimal media, slower growth or stress responses might alter cell size, shape, or the production of these extracellular substances, resulting in smaller, drier, or differently shaped colonies.",
      "explanation": "Nutrient availability affects growth rate and the production of various cellular components (e.g., capsules, pigments, extracellular polysaccharides) that contribute to colony morphology.

      "answer": "After one round of replication in 14N medium, all DNA was of intermediate density (hybrid 15N/14N). This result was consistent with both semi-conservative and dispersive replication models, but it ruled out conservative replication (which would have yielded one heavy 15N/15N band and one light 14N/14N band). Continuing to a second round of replication was crucial. In the second round, semi-conservative replication predicted two bands: one intermediate (15N/14N) and one light (14N/14N). Dispersive replication would have predicted a single band of DNA, with each molecule containing less 15N than after the first round, gradually becoming lighter. The appearance of two distinct bands (intermediate and light) after the second round confirmed the semi-conservative model.",

If deoxyribonucleotides lacking the 3'-OH group (dideoxyribonucleotides, ddNTPs) are incorporated, DNA synthesis will terminate at that point. This is because there will be no 3'-OH group available for the addition of the next nucleotide, effectively blocking further elongation of the DNA strand. This principle is used in Sanger DNA sequencing.",

Decrease promoter strength: If the alteration makes the sequence less similar to the consensus, RNA polymerase binding may be weakened, leading to reduced transcription initiation and lower gene expression. 2. Increase promoter strength (less common): If the alteration makes the sequence more similar to an optimal consensus or a consensus recognized by a more active sigma factor, transcription could potentially increase. 3.

      "answer": "There are 4 different nucleotide bases in mRNA (A, U, G, C). To code for 20 different amino acids: - If codons were 1 nucleotide long, only 4^1 = 4 amino acids could be specified. - If codons were 2 nucleotides long, only 4^2 = 16 amino acids could be specified. This is still less than the 20 amino acids. - If codons were 3 nucleotides long, 4^3 = 64 possible codons could be formed. This is more than enough to specify 20 amino acids, allowing for redundancy (multiple codons for one amino acid) and stop codons. Therefore, codons must be at least three nucleotides long to uniquely specify all 20 common amino acids.",
      "explanation": "With 4 bases: 1-base codons yield 4^1=4 combinations (too few for 20 amino acids). 2-base codons yield 4^2=16 combinations (still too few). 3-base codons yield 4^3=64 combinations, which is sufficient to code for 20 amino acids plus stop signals, allowing for degeneracy."
