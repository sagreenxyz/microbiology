# Chapter 11: Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics - Summary

## 11.1 DNA Replication
*   **Semiconservative Replication:** Each new double-stranded DNA molecule consists of one original (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand. (Meselson-Stahl experiment).
*   **Process in Bacteria:**
    1.  **Initiation:** Begins at the origin of replication (oriC). Proteins bind to oriC, unwinding DNA.
    2.  **Enzymes Involved:**
        *   **Helicase:** Unwinds the DNA double helix at the replication fork.
        *   **Single-Strand Binding Proteins (SSBs):** Stabilize unwound single-stranded DNA.
        *   **Topoisomerase (DNA Gyrase):** Relaxes supercoiling ahead of the replication fork.
        *   **Primase (RNA Polymerase):** Synthesizes short RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase to start.
        *   **DNA Polymerase III:** Main enzyme for synthesizing new DNA strands; adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction. Has proofreading activity (3' to 5' exonuclease).
        *   **DNA Polymerase I:** Removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA. Also has proofreading activity.
        *   **DNA Ligase:** Joins DNA fragments (Okazaki fragments) by forming phosphodiester bonds.
    3.  **Elongation:**
        *   **Leading Strand:** Synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction towards the replication fork.
        *   **Lagging Strand:** Synthesized discontinuously in short segments (Okazaki fragments) away from the replication fork, also in a 5' to 3' direction. RNA primers are needed for each fragment.
    4.  **Termination:** Replication forks meet; in circular chromosomes, topoisomerases separate the interlocked daughter chromosomes.
*   **Bidirectional Replication:** Two replication forks move in opposite directions from the origin.
*   **Eukaryotic DNA Replication:** Similar principles but more complex: multiple origins of replication, different DNA polymerases, telomeres (ends of linear chromosomes require telomerase).

## 11.2 RNA Transcription
*   **Transcription:** Synthesis of an RNA molecule from a DNA template.
*   **Process in Bacteria:**
    1.  **Initiation:**
        *   **RNA Polymerase:** Main enzyme, binds to a specific DNA sequence called the promoter (e.g., -10 and -35 consensus sequences).
        *   **Sigma Factor (Ïƒ):** Part of RNA polymerase holoenzyme, recognizes and binds to the promoter, then dissociates after initiation.
        *   DNA unwinds at the promoter, forming a transcription bubble.
    2.  **Elongation:**
        *   RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule in the 5' to 3' direction. Uracil (U) pairs with adenine (A) in DNA.
    3.  **Termination:**
        *   RNA polymerase reaches a terminator sequence on the DNA.
        *   **Rho-dependent termination:** Rho protein binds to RNA and moves towards RNA polymerase, causing it to detach.
        *   **Rho-independent termination:** Terminator sequence forms a hairpin loop in the RNA, followed by a string of U's, causing RNA polymerase to dissociate.
*   **Eukaryotic Transcription:** More complex: multiple RNA polymerases, transcription factors required, RNA processing (5' cap, 3' poly-A tail, splicing of introns). Occurs in the nucleus.

## 11.3 Protein Synthesis (Translation)
*   **Translation:** Synthesis of a protein from an mRNA template. Occurs on ribosomes.
*   **The Genetic Code:**
    *   **Codons:** Three-nucleotide sequences on mRNA that specify amino acids or stop signals.
    *   **Degeneracy (Redundancy):** Most amino acids are coded by more than one codon.
    *   **Start Codon:** AUG (usually codes for methionine, or N-formylmethionine in bacteria).
    *   **Stop Codons (Nonsense Codons):** UAA, UAG, UGA; signal termination of translation.
    *   **Reading Frame:** The way codons are grouped into sets of three; established by the start codon.
*   **Components:**
    *   **mRNA:** Carries the genetic code.
    *   **tRNA:** Adaptor molecules; each carries a specific amino acid and has an anticodon complementary to an mRNA codon. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases attach correct amino acids to tRNAs ("charging").
    *   **Ribosomes:** Composed of rRNA and proteins. Two subunits (e.g., 30S and 50S in bacteria, forming a 70S ribosome). Have A (aminoacyl), P (peptidyl), and E (exit) sites for tRNA binding.
*   **Process in Bacteria:**
    1.  **Initiation:**
        *   Small ribosomal subunit (30S) binds to mRNA at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome-binding site).
        *   Initiator tRNA (carrying fMet) binds to the start codon (AUG) in the P site.
        *   Large ribosomal subunit (50S) joins, forming the initiation complex. Initiation factors (IFs) are involved.
    2.  **Elongation:**
        *   A charged tRNA with an anticodon complementary to the next mRNA codon enters the A site.
        *   Peptide bond formation: The amino acid from the tRNA in the P site is transferred to the amino acid on the tRNA in the A site (catalyzed by peptidyl transferase activity of rRNA in the large subunit).
        *   Translocation: Ribosome moves one codon down the mRNA. The tRNA from the P site moves to the E site and exits; the tRNA from the A site (now holding the polypeptide) moves to the P site. The A site is now empty for the next charged tRNA. Elongation factors (EFs) are involved.
    3.  **Termination:**
        *   Ribosome reaches a stop codon on mRNA.
        *   Release factors (RFs) bind to the stop codon in the A site.
        *   Polypeptide is released from the tRNA in the P site.
        *   Ribosomal subunits, mRNA, and tRNA dissociate.
*   **Eukaryotic Translation:** Similar but initiator tRNA carries methionine (not fMet), ribosome binds to 5' cap of mRNA, different initiation and elongation factors.
*   **Coupled Transcription and Translation:** In prokaryotes, translation can begin while mRNA is still being transcribed because there is no nucleus separating DNA and ribosomes.

## 11.4 Mutations
*   **Mutation:** A permanent, heritable change in the DNA sequence.
*   **Types of Mutations:**
    *   **Point Mutation (Base Substitution):** Change in a single base pair.
        *   **Silent Mutation:** No change in amino acid sequence (due to degeneracy of genetic code).
        *   **Missense Mutation:** Results in a different amino acid. Effect can vary (e.g., conservative vs. non-conservative substitution).
        *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein.
    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** Insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotide pairs (not in multiples of three). Shifts the reading frame, altering all downstream amino acids and often creating a premature stop codon.
*   **Causes of Mutations:**
    *   **Spontaneous Mutations:** Occur naturally due to errors in DNA replication or other cellular processes.
    *   **Induced Mutations:** Caused by mutagens (external agents).
        *   **Chemical Mutagens:**
            *   Nucleoside analogs (e.g., 2-aminopurine, 5-bromouracil): Incorporated into DNA and cause incorrect base pairing.
            *   Modifying agents (e.g., nitrous acid): Alter existing bases.
            *   Intercalating agents (e.g., ethidium bromide, acridine orange): Insert between base pairs, causing frameshifts.
        *   **Radiation:**
            *   Ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma rays): Causes DNA strand breaks, base damage.
            *   Nonionizing radiation (UV light): Causes formation of pyrimidine dimers (e.g., thymine dimers), distorting DNA and interfering with replication/transcription.
*   **DNA Repair Mechanisms:**
    *   **Proofreading:** By DNA polymerases during replication.
    *   **Mismatch Repair:** Corrects errors missed by proofreading after replication.
    *   **Photoreactivation (Light Repair):** Enzyme photolyase uses visible light to break pyrimidine dimers (not in placental mammals).
    *   **Nucleotide Excision Repair (Dark Repair):** Enzymes cut out damaged DNA segment (e.g., thymine dimer); DNA polymerase fills the gap, DNA ligase seals.
    *   **Base Excision Repair:** Removes a single damaged base.
    *   **SOS Response (in bacteria):** Inducible repair system for extensive DNA damage; error-prone but allows cell survival.
*   **Identifying Mutants:**
    *   **Positive (Direct) Selection:** Selects for mutants by eliminating wild-type cells (e.g., antibiotic resistance).
    *   **Negative (Indirect) Selection:** Selects for cells that cannot perform a certain function (e.g., auxotrophs - mutants requiring a specific nutrient). Replica plating is often used.
    *   **Ames Test:** Uses auxotrophic bacteria (e.g., *Salmonella* histidine auxotrophs) to detect chemical mutagens by measuring the rate of reversion to prototrophy. Liver extract can be added to test for mutagenicity of metabolically activated compounds.

## 11.5 Horizontal Gene Transfer in Prokaryotes
*   **Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT):** Transfer of genetic material between organisms of the same generation (not by descent from parent to offspring - vertical gene transfer).
*   **Mechanisms:**
    1.  **Transformation:** Uptake of naked DNA from the environment by a competent cell.
        *   **Competence:** Physiological state allowing a cell to take up DNA. Can be natural or induced.
    2.  **Transduction:** Transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another via a bacteriophage.
        *   **Generalized Transduction:** Any bacterial DNA fragment can be accidentally packaged into a phage head during lytic cycle and transferred.
        *   **Specialized Transduction:** Specific bacterial genes adjacent to an integrated prophage are transferred when the prophage excises imprecisely from the host chromosome.
    3.  **Conjugation:** Transfer of DNA directly from one bacterium (donor) to another (recipient) through cell-to-cell contact, often involving a pilus.
        *   **F Factor (Fertility Factor) Mediated Conjugation (in *E. coli*):**
            *   F factor is a plasmid carrying genes for pilus formation and DNA transfer.
            *   **F<sup>+</sup> cell (donor):** Contains F factor.
            *   **F<sup>-</sup> cell (recipient):** Lacks F factor.
            *   F<sup>+</sup> x F<sup>-</sup> mating: F factor is replicated and transferred; F<sup>-</sup> cell becomes F<sup>+</sup>.
            *   **Hfr (High Frequency of Recombination) cell:** F factor integrates into the bacterial chromosome. During conjugation, part of the F factor and adjacent chromosomal DNA are transferred. Recipient usually remains F<sup>-</sup> because entire F factor is rarely transferred.
            *   **F' cell:** F factor excises imprecisely from Hfr chromosome, taking some chromosomal DNA with it, forming an F' plasmid.
*   **Significance of HGT:** Major mechanism for spread of antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, and metabolic capabilities, contributing to microbial evolution and adaptation.

## 11.6 Transposons ("Jumping Genes")
*   **Transposons (Transposable Elements):** Segments of DNA that can move from one location to another within a genome (transposition).
*   Discovered by Barbara McClintock.
*   **Structure:**
    *   Contain inverted repeats (IRs) at their ends.
    *   Often carry a gene for transposase (enzyme that catalyzes transposition).
*   **Types:**
    *   **Insertion Sequences (IS elements):** Simplest transposons; contain only IRs and the gene for transposase.
    *   **Complex Transposons (Composite Transposons):** Carry other genes (e.g., antibiotic resistance) in addition to transposase gene, often flanked by IS elements.
*   **Mechanism of Transposition:**
    *   **Cut-and-paste (non-replicative):** Transposon excises from original site and inserts into a new site.
    *   **Copy-and-paste (replicative):** Transposon is replicated, and the copy inserts into a new site, while the original remains at its location.
*   **Effects of Transposition:** Can cause mutations if they insert into a gene, alter gene expression, or promote DNA rearrangements (deletions, inversions).
