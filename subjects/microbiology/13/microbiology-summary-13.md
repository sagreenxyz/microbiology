# Chapter 13: Control of Microbial Growth - Summary

## 13.1 Terminology of Microbial Control
*   **Sterilization:** The complete removal or destruction of all living microorganisms, including endospores.
*   **Commercial Sterilization:** Sufficient heat treatment to kill *Clostridium botulinum* endospores in canned food. Thermophilic endospore-formers may survive but won't grow at normal storage temperatures.
*   **Disinfection:** Destruction of vegetative (non-endospore-forming) pathogens on inanimate objects. May not kill endospores.
    *   **Disinfectant:** Chemical used for disinfection.
*   **Antisepsis:** Destruction of vegetative pathogens on living tissue.
    *   **Antiseptic:** Chemical used for antisepsis.
*   **Degerming (Degermation):** Mechanical removal of microbes from a limited area (e.g., skin swabbing with alcohol before injection).
*   **Sanitization:** Lowering microbial counts on eating and drinking utensils to safe public health levels.
*   **-cide (suffix):** To kill (e.g., biocide, fungicide, virucide).
*   **-stat or -stasis (suffix):** To inhibit growth and multiplication (e.g., bacteriostasis).
*   **Sepsis:** Microbial contamination.
*   **Asepsis:** Absence of significant contamination. Aseptic techniques prevent contamination.

## 13.2 Measuring Microbial Control
*   **Rate of Microbial Death:** Microbes die at a constant rate when exposed to an antimicrobial agent.
*   **Factors Influencing Effectiveness of Antimicrobial Treatments:**
    *   **Number of Microbes:** Higher load requires more time or higher concentration.
    *   **Environmental Influences:** Presence of organic matter (e.g., blood, vomit, feces) can inhibit chemical antimicrobials. Temperature (disinfectants often work better in warm solutions). Biofilms are more resistant.
    *   **Time of Exposure:** Longer exposure is generally more effective.
    *   **Microbial Characteristics:** Endospores, mycobacteria (waxy cell walls), protozoan cysts, Gram-negative bacteria (outer membrane), and viruses without envelopes are generally more resistant. Prions are extremely resistant.

## 13.3 Physical Methods of Microbial Control
*   **Heat:** Denatures proteins.
    *   **Moist Heat:** More effective than dry heat; coagulates proteins.
        *   **Boiling (100°C):** Kills most vegetative pathogens, viruses, fungi within ~10 min. Does not reliably kill endospores. (Disinfection)
        *   **Autoclave (Steam Under Pressure):** Preferred method of sterilization. Achieves higher temperatures than boiling water (e.g., 121°C at 15 psi for 15 min). Kills all organisms and endospores.
        *   **Pasteurization:** Mild heating to kill pathogens and reduce spoilage organisms in liquids (e.g., milk, beer). Does not sterilize.
            *   High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST): 72°C for 15 sec.
            *   Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT): 140°C for <1 sec (can sterilize if packaged aseptically).
    *   **Dry Heat:**
        *   **Direct Flaming/Incineration:** Sterilization (e.g., inoculating loops).
        *   **Hot-Air Sterilization:** Requires higher temperatures and longer times than moist heat (e.g., 170°C for 2 hours). For items damaged by moist heat.
*   **Filtration:** Removes microbes from liquids or air. Used for heat-sensitive materials.
    *   **Membrane Filters:** Pore sizes typically 0.22 µm or 0.45 µm (removes bacteria). Smaller pores for viruses.
    *   **High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) Filters:** Remove microbes >0.3 µm from air (e.g., in biological safety cabinets, operating rooms).
*   **Low Temperatures:** Inhibit microbial growth (bacteriostatic).
    *   **Refrigeration (0-7°C):** Slows metabolism of most microbes.
    *   **Freezing (<0°C):** Stops microbial growth; some microbes killed by ice crystals.
*   **High Pressure (Pascalization):** Denatures proteins, alters cell membranes. Used for food preservation.
*   **Desiccation (Drying):** Prevents metabolism (bacteriostatic). Microbes can remain viable for long periods.
*   **Osmotic Pressure:** High concentrations of salt or sugar create a hypertonic environment, causing plasmolysis. Used in food preservation.
*   **Radiation:**
    *   **Ionizing Radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, electron beams):** Short wavelength, high energy. Damages DNA by creating ions and free radicals. Used for sterilizing medical supplies, food. High penetration.
    *   **Nonionizing Radiation (UV light):** Longer wavelength. Damages DNA by forming pyrimidine (thymine) dimers. Low penetration. Used for disinfecting surfaces, air, water.

## 13.4 Chemical Methods of Microbial Control
*   **Principles of Effective Disinfection:** Concentration of disinfectant, organic matter presence, pH, time of contact.
*   **Evaluating Disinfectants:**
    *   **Use-Dilution Test:** Standard method. Metal or glass cylinders dipped in bacterial cultures, dried, then exposed to disinfectant for a set time. Cylinders placed in growth medium to check for survivors.
    *   **Disk-Diffusion Method (Kirby-Bauer variant):** Filter paper disks soaked in disinfectant placed on an agar plate inoculated with bacteria. Zone of inhibition around disk indicates effectiveness.
*   **Types of Disinfectants and Antiseptics:**
    *   **Phenol and Phenolics (e.g., Lysol, O-phenylphenol):** Disrupt plasma membranes, denature proteins. Effective in presence of organic matter.
    *   **Bisphenols (e.g., Triclosan, Hexachlorophene):** Disrupt plasma membranes.
    *   **Biguanides (e.g., Chlorhexidine):** Disrupt plasma membranes. Used for skin antisepsis.
    *   **Halogens:**
        *   **Iodine:** Impairs protein synthesis and alters cell membranes. Tincture (in alcohol) or iodophor (combined with organic molecule, e.g., Betadine). Antiseptic.
        *   **Chlorine:** Strong oxidizing agent (e.g., hypochlorous acid from bleach - sodium hypochlorite). Disinfectant for water, surfaces.
    *   **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, Isopropanol):** Denature proteins, disrupt lipids. Require water for activity (70% solutions most effective). Degerming agent, disinfectant. Not effective against endospores or non-enveloped viruses.
    *   **Heavy Metals (e.g., Silver, Mercury, Copper, Zinc):** Oligodynamic action - denature proteins by combining with sulfhydryl groups. Silver nitrate (antiseptic), copper sulfate (algicide).
    *   **Surface-Active Agents (Surfactants):**
        *   **Soaps and Detergents:** Mechanical removal of microbes (degerming). Emulsify oils.
        *   **Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (Quats, e.g., Benzalkonium chloride):** Cationic detergents. Disrupt plasma membranes. Less effective against Gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, endospores.
    *   **Chemical Food Preservatives:**
        *   **Organic Acids (e.g., Sorbic acid, Benzoic acid, Propionic acid):** Inhibit metabolism, affect plasma membranes. Control mold and bacterial growth in foods.
        *   **Nitrites and Nitrates:** Prevent endospore germination in meats (e.g., *C. botulinum*). Can form nitrosamines (carcinogenic).
    *   **Aldehydes (e.g., Formaldehyde, Glutaraldehyde):** Inactivate proteins by forming covalent cross-links. Highly effective, can sterilize (chemical sterilants). Glutaraldehyde used for medical equipment.
    *   **Chemical Sterilization (Gaseous Sterilants, e.g., Ethylene Oxide):** Denature proteins. Used for heat-sensitive materials. Highly penetrating but toxic and explosive.
    *   **Peroxygens (Oxidizing Agents, e.g., Hydrogen Peroxide, Peracetic Acid, Ozone):** Oxidize cellular components.
        *   Hydrogen peroxide: Antiseptic at low concentrations, sterilant at high concentrations.
        *   Peracetic acid: Effective liquid sterilant.
        *   Ozone: Disinfects water.
