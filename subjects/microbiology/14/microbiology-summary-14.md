# Chapter 14: Antimicrobial Drugs - Summary

## 14.1 History of Chemotherapy
*   **Chemotherapy:** Treatment of disease with chemical substances.
*   **Antimicrobial Drugs:** Interfere with the growth of microbes within a host.
*   **Antibiotic:** A substance produced by a microorganism that, in small amounts, inhibits another microorganism. (Many modern "antibiotics" are synthetic or semi-synthetic).
*   **Paul Ehrlich (early 1900s):** Concept of "magic bullet." Developed Salvarsan (arsphenamine) to treat syphilis.
*   **Alexander Fleming (1928):** Discovered penicillin produced by the mold *Penicillium notatum*.
*   **Gerhard Domagk (1930s):** Discovered sulfa drugs (sulfonamides).
*   **Selman Waksman (1940s):** Discovered streptomycin (produced by *Streptomyces griseus*), effective against tuberculosis. Coined the term "antibiotic."
*   **Selective Toxicity:** The ability of a drug to harm the target microbe without harming the host. Key principle in antimicrobial therapy.

## 14.2 Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Drug Action
*   **Major Modes of Action:**
    1.  **Inhibition of Cell Wall Synthesis:**
        *   Target peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to cell lysis. Generally have high selective toxicity.
        *   **Penicillins (β-lactams):** Inhibit peptide cross-linking in peptidoglycan. Natural (Penicillin G, V), semi-synthetic (ampicillin, amoxicillin, methicillin).
        *   **Cephalosporins (β-lactams):** Similar mechanism to penicillins, broader spectrum.
        *   **Carbapenems & Monobactams (β-lactams):** Broad-spectrum.
        *   **Bacitracin:** Interferes with synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors. Topical use.
        *   **Vancomycin (glycopeptide):** Inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis by binding to D-Ala-D-Ala portion of peptide side chains. Important for MRSA.
        *   **Isoniazid (INH) & Ethambutol:** Inhibit mycolic acid synthesis (for *Mycobacterium*).
    2.  **Inhibition of Protein Synthesis:**
        *   Target prokaryotic 70S ribosomes (different from eukaryotic 80S ribosomes), providing selective toxicity.
        *   **Aminoglycosides (e.g., Streptomycin, Gentamicin, Neomycin):** Bind to 30S subunit, cause misreading of mRNA.
        *   **Tetracyclines (e.g., Doxycycline):** Bind to 30S subunit, block tRNA attachment to A site. Broad spectrum.
        *   **Chloramphenicol:** Binds to 50S subunit, inhibits peptide bond formation. Broad spectrum, but can cause aplastic anemia.
        *   **Macrolides (e.g., Erythromycin, Azithromycin):** Bind to 50S subunit, prevent translocation.
        *   **Lincosamides (e.g., Clindamycin):** Bind to 50S subunit.
        *   **Streptogramins:** Bind to 50S subunit.
        *   **Oxazolidinones (e.g., Linezolid):** Bind to 50S subunit, prevent formation of 70S initiation complex. Synthetic, useful for MRSA, VRE.
    3.  **Injury to the Plasma Membrane:**
        *   Disrupt membrane structure or function. Can affect both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, so often have lower selective toxicity.
        *   **Polymyxin B:** Disrupts outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Topical use.
        *   **Daptomycin:** Disrupts plasma membrane of Gram-positive bacteria.
    4.  **Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Synthesis:**
        *   Interfere with DNA replication or transcription. Often affect both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA/RNA synthesis, leading to potential toxicity.
        *   **Rifamycins (e.g., Rifampin):** Inhibit bacterial RNA polymerase (transcription).
        *   **Quinolones and Fluoroquinolones (e.g., Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin):** Inhibit DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV, interfering with DNA replication. Broad spectrum.
    5.  **Inhibition of Essential Metabolite Synthesis (Antimetabolites):**
        *   Block metabolic pathways by competitively inhibiting enzymes or being incorporated as nonfunctional analogs.
        *   **Sulfonamides (Sulfa drugs) & Trimethoprim:** Inhibit folic acid synthesis pathway (folic acid is essential for nucleic acid synthesis). Often used in combination (TMP-SMX) for synergistic effect. Humans obtain folic acid from diet, so selectively toxic.

## 14.3 Antifungal Drugs
*   Fungi are eukaryotes, so finding selectively toxic targets is more difficult.
*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   **Inhibition of Ergosterol Synthesis (in fungal cell membranes):**
        *   **Polyenes (e.g., Amphotericin B, Nystatin):** Bind to ergosterol, disrupt membrane integrity. Amphotericin B is toxic.
        *   **Azoles (e.g., Miconazole, Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole):** Inhibit ergosterol synthesis.
        *   **Allylamines (e.g., Terbinafine):** Inhibit ergosterol synthesis.
    *   **Inhibition of Cell Wall Synthesis (target β-glucan):**
        *   **Echinocandins (e.g., Caspofungin):** Inhibit synthesis of β-glucan in fungal cell walls.
    *   **Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Synthesis:**
        *   **Flucytosine:** Analog of cytosine, converted to 5-fluorouracil in fungi, interferes with RNA and DNA synthesis.
    *   **Other Mechanisms:** Griseofulvin (inhibits microtubule function, used for superficial mycoses).

## 14.4 Antiprotozoan Drugs
*   Protozoa are eukaryotes; selective toxicity is challenging.
*   Examples:
    *   **Quinine and Chloroquine, Mefloquine, Artemisinin:** Used to treat malaria (target *Plasmodium*). Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are current standard.
    *   **Metronidazole (Flagyl):** Effective against anaerobic protozoa (e.g., *Giardia*, *Trichomonas*) and anaerobic bacteria. Damages DNA.
    *   **Nitazoxanide:** Broad-spectrum, used for cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis.
    *   Others: Pentamidine, Suramin.

## 14.5 Antihelminthic Drugs
*   Helminths are multicellular animals; selective toxicity is difficult.
*   Mechanisms often involve interfering with neuromuscular function, carbohydrate metabolism, or microtubule formation.
*   Examples:
    *   **Niclosamide:** Inhibits ATP production (for tapeworms).
    *   **Praziquantel:** Alters membrane permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, causes paralysis (for flukes, tapeworms).
    *   **Mebendazole and Albendazole (Benzimidazoles):** Inhibit microtubule formation, disrupt nutrient absorption (broad-spectrum antihelminthics).
    *   **Ivermectin:** Paralyzes helminths by interfering with nerve and muscle function (broad spectrum, also used for ectoparasites).

## 14.6 Antiviral Drugs
*   Viruses replicate within host cells, making selective toxicity extremely difficult.
*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   **Inhibition of Virus Entry/Fusion/Uncoating:**
        *   Entry inhibitors (e.g., Enfuvirtide for HIV).
        *   Fusion inhibitors.
        *   Uncoating inhibitors (e.g., Amantadine, Rimantadine for influenza A - largely resistant now).
    *   **Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Synthesis (Nucleoside/Nucleotide Analogs):**
        *   Analogs are incorporated into viral DNA or RNA, terminating synthesis or causing mutations.
        *   Examples: Acyclovir (for herpesviruses), Ganciclovir (for CMV), Zidovudine (AZT - for HIV, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor), Ribavirin (broad-spectrum antiviral).
    *   **Inhibition of Viral Enzymes:**
        *   **Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (for retroviruses like HIV):**
            *   Nucleoside/Nucleotide RT Inhibitors (NRTIs, e.g., AZT, Tenofovir).
            *   Non-Nucleoside RT Inhibitors (NNRTIs, e.g., Efavirenz, Nevirapine).
        *   **Protease Inhibitors (for HIV, Hepatitis C):** Block cleavage of viral polyproteins into functional proteins (e.g., Saquinavir, Ritonavir for HIV).
        *   **Integrase Inhibitors (for HIV):** Prevent integration of viral DNA into host chromosome (e.g., Raltegravir).
        *   **Neuraminidase Inhibitors (for Influenza):** Block release of new virions (e.g., Oseltamivir - Tamiflu, Zanamivir - Relenza).
    *   **Interferons:** Host-produced cytokines with antiviral activity. Recombinant interferons used therapeutically (e.g., for hepatitis B and C).

## 14.7 Drug Resistance
*   **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** The ability of a microbe to withstand the effects of an antimicrobial drug that was originally effective for treatment.
*   **Mechanisms of Resistance:**
    1.  **Blocking Entry:** Altered porins or cell wall components prevent drug uptake.
    2.  **Inactivation by Enzymes:** Microbe produces enzymes that destroy or inactivate the drug (e.g., β-lactamases inactivate penicillins).
    3.  **Alteration of Target Molecule:** Drug target site is modified so drug no longer binds effectively (e.g., altered ribosomes, DNA gyrase, penicillin-binding proteins).
    4.  **Efflux of Antibiotic:** Microbe develops efflux pumps that actively transport the drug out of the cell.
    5.  **Alteration of Metabolic Pathway:** Microbe develops alternative pathways or increases production of the targeted metabolite.
*   **Origin and Spread of Resistance:**
    *   **Spontaneous Mutations:** Random mutations can confer resistance.
    *   **Horizontal Gene Transfer:** Resistance genes (often on plasmids or transposons) can be transferred between bacteria via transformation, transduction, or conjugation.
*   **Factors Contributing to AMR:**
    *   Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture.
    *   Lack of new antibiotic development.
    *   Poor infection control practices.
*   **Consequences:** Increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs. Emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms (e.g., MRSA, VRE, CRE).
*   **Strategies to Combat AMR:**
    *   Prudent antibiotic use (stewardship).
    *   Development of new drugs and alternative therapies (e.g., phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides).
    *   Improved diagnostics to ensure appropriate drug selection.
    *   Infection prevention and control.
    *   Combination therapy (using multiple drugs).

## 14.8 Testing Antimicrobial Effectiveness
*   **Disk-Diffusion Method (Kirby-Bauer Test):**
    *   Agar plate inoculated with test organism. Paper disks containing known concentrations of antibiotics are placed on the surface.
    *   Zone of inhibition (clear area around disk where growth is inhibited) is measured. Size of zone correlates with susceptibility. Standardized tables used for interpretation (Susceptible, Intermediate, Resistant).
*   **Broth Dilution Tests:**
    *   Determine Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC).
    *   **MIC:** Lowest concentration of an antimicrobial drug that visibly inhibits microbial growth after incubation.
    *   **MBC:** Lowest concentration of an antimicrobial drug that kills ≥99.9% of the initial inoculum.
    *   Can be done in tubes or microtiter plates.
*   **Etest (Epsilometer Test):**
    *   Plastic strip with a gradient of antibiotic concentrations is placed on an inoculated agar plate.
    *   Elliptical zone of inhibition forms. MIC is read where the ellipse intersects the strip.
*   **Automated Systems:** Rapidly identify organisms and determine susceptibility profiles.
