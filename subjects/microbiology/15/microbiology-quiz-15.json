      "question_number": 1,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question_text": "What is the primary role of mitochondria in a eukaryotic cell?",
      "options": [
        "Protein synthesis",
        "Energy production (ATP synthesis)",
        "Lipid storage",
        "Waste degradation"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Energy production (ATP synthesis)",
      "explanation": "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell because they are responsible for generating most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy."

        "false"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "false",
      "explanation": "Many bacteria are beneficial, such as those in the human gut that aid digestion, or those used in food production (e.g., yogurt, cheese). Only a small percentage of bacteria are pathogenic."
