# Chapter 15: Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity - Summary

## 15.1 Pathogenicity and Virulence
*   **Pathogen:** A microorganism capable of causing disease.
*   **Pathogenicity:** The ability of a microbe to cause disease.
*   **Virulence:** The degree or extent of pathogenicity.
*   **Virulence Factors:** Microbial components or products that contribute to virulence (e.g., toxins, adhesins, capsules).
*   **Opportunistic Pathogens:** Cause disease only in compromised hosts (e.g., weakened immune system, breach of normal barriers) or when introduced into an unusual body site.
*   **Primary (Frank) Pathogens:** Cause disease in healthy individuals.
*   **ID<sub>50</sub> (Infectious Dose 50%):** Number of microbial cells or virions required to cause infection in 50% of an experimental group of hosts. Measures infectivity. Lower ID<sub>50</sub> = more infectious.
*   **LD<sub>50</sub> (Lethal Dose 50%):** Number of microbial cells, virions, or amount of toxin required to cause death in 50% of an experimental group of hosts. Measures virulence/potency of a toxin. Lower LD<sub>50</sub> = more virulent/potent.

## 15.2 Portals of Entry
*   The specific route by which a pathogen enters the host's body.
*   **Mucous Membranes:**
    *   **Respiratory Tract:** Most common portal of entry (e.g., inhalation of droplets, dust).
    *   **Gastrointestinal Tract:** Entry via contaminated food, water, fingers. Pathogens must survive stomach acid, enzymes, bile.
    *   **Genitourinary Tract:** Entry via sexual contact or opportunistic infections.
    *   **Conjunctiva (Eyes):**
*   **Skin:**
    *   Intact skin is generally an effective barrier.
    *   Entry through hair follicles, sweat gland ducts, or breaks in the skin (cuts, wounds, bites).
*   **Parenteral Route:**
    *   Microbes deposited directly into tissues beneath the skin or mucous membranes (e.g., via punctures, injections, bites, surgery).
*   **Preferred Portal of Entry:** Many pathogens have a preferred portal; infection may not occur if they enter by another route.

## 15.3 Adhesion
*   Process by which pathogens attach to host tissues at the portal of entry. Essential for colonization.
*   **Adhesins (Ligands):** Surface molecules on the pathogen (usually glycoproteins or lipoproteins) that bind to specific complementary receptors on host cells.
    *   Located on glycocalyx, fimbriae, pili, flagella, or cell wall.
*   **Host Receptors:** Typically sugars (e.g., mannose) on host cell surfaces.
*   **Biofilms:** Communities of microbes that adhere to surfaces and each other, often encased in an EPS matrix. Adhesion is critical for biofilm formation. Biofilms can increase virulence and resistance.

## 15.4 Invasion and Evasion of Host Defenses
*   **Invasion:** Pathogen's ability to spread into host tissues.
    *   **Extracellular Enzymes (Exoenzymes):** Secreted by pathogens to break down host tissues, facilitate spread, or obtain nutrients.
        *   **Coagulases:** Coagulate fibrinogen in blood, forming clots (may protect bacteria from phagocytosis).
        *   **Kinases (e.g., Streptokinase, Staphylokinase):** Digest fibrin clots, allowing pathogen to spread.
        *   **Hyaluronidase:** Hydrolyzes hyaluronic acid (a polysaccharide that holds cells together in connective tissue), promoting spread.
        *   **Collagenase:** Breaks down collagen (protein in connective tissue), facilitating spread.
        *   **IgA Proteases:** Destroy IgA antibodies (found in mucosal secretions).
    *   **Antigenic Variation:** Pathogen alters its surface antigens to evade host antibodies.
    *   **Invasins:** Surface proteins that cause host cell cytoskeleton rearrangement, leading to pathogen engulfment (e.g., by membrane ruffling). Used by some bacteria to enter non-phagocytic host cells.
    *   **Intracellular Pathogens:** Some pathogens can survive and replicate inside host cells (e.g., phagocytes or non-phagocytic cells), evading immune defenses.
        *   Mechanisms: Escape phagosome, prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion, resist lysosomal enzymes.
*   **Evasion of Host Defenses:**
    *   **Capsules:** Glycocalyx layer that impairs phagocytosis by preventing adherence of phagocytes.
    *   **Cell Wall Components:**
        *   **M protein (*Streptococcus pyogenes*):** Mediates attachment, helps resist phagocytosis.
        *   **Mycolic acids (*Mycobacterium tuberculosis*):** Waxy lipids that resist digestion by phagocytes.
    *   **Leukocidins:** Kill white blood cells (phagocytes).
    *   **Hemolysins:** Lyse red blood cells (and other cells).
    *   **Biofilm Formation:** Provides protection.
    *   **Survival Inside Phagocytes.**

## 15.5 Damage to Host Cells
*   **Direct Damage:**
    *   Pathogen grows in host cells, causing cell lysis upon release.
    *   Metabolic waste products of pathogens can damage host tissues.
*   **Toxins:** Poisonous substances produced by certain microorganisms that contribute to pathogenicity.
    *   **Toxigenicity:** Ability of a microbe to produce toxins.
    *   **Toxemia:** Presence of toxins in the blood.
    *   **Toxoid:** Inactivated toxin used in a vaccine (e.g., tetanus toxoid).
    *   **Antitoxin:** Antibodies produced by the host that neutralize a specific toxin.
    *   **Exotoxins:**
        *   Proteins secreted by living bacteria (mostly Gram-positive, some Gram-negative).
        *   Highly potent, specific effects on host cells. Genes often on plasmids or phages.
        *   **Types of Exotoxins:**
            *   **A-B Toxins:** Two components: A (Active) part is the enzyme causing damage; B (Binding) part attaches to host cell receptor. (e.g., Diphtheria toxin, Cholera toxin, Botulinum toxin, Tetanus toxin).
            *   **Membrane-Disrupting Toxins:** Cause lysis of host cells by disrupting plasma membranes (e.g., leukocidins, hemolysins like streptolysins).
            *   **Superantigens:** Provoke an intense, nonspecific immune response by stimulating proliferation of T cells and release of excessive cytokines. Can cause fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shock, death (e.g., Staphylococcal enterotoxin, toxic shock syndrome toxin).
    *   **Endotoxins:**
        *   Lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.
        *   Released when Gram-negative bacteria die and their cell walls lyse.
        *   Cause general systemic effects: fever (pyrogenic response via IL-1), chills, weakness, aches, shock (septic shock due to cytokine release, e.g., TNF-Î±), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
        *   Less potent and less specific than most exotoxins. Cannot be converted to toxoids.
        *   Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Assay: Used to detect endotoxins in drugs, medical devices.
*   **Pathogenic Properties of Viruses:**
    *   **Cytopathic Effects (CPEs):** Visible effects of viral infection on host cells (e.g., cell lysis, syncytium formation, inclusion bodies).
    *   Evade immune system (e.g., hide in cells, antigenic variation).
    *   Some viruses cause cancer (oncogenic viruses).
*   **Pathogenic Properties of Fungi, Protozoa, Helminths:**
    *   Fungi: Mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxin), proteases, capsules. Allergic responses.
    *   Protozoa & Helminths: Direct damage by growth, waste products, nutrient depletion. Avoidance of host defenses (e.g., antigenic variation, intracellular survival).

## 15.6 Portals of Exit
*   Routes by which pathogens leave the host's body to spread to other hosts.
*   Often related to the portal of entry or site of infection.
*   Examples:
    *   **Respiratory Tract:** Coughing, sneezing (droplets).
    *   **Gastrointestinal Tract:** Feces, saliva.
    *   **Genitourinary Tract:** Urine, vaginal/penile secretions.
    *   **Skin:** Lesions, drainage.
    *   **Blood:** Biting arthropods, needles/syringes.
