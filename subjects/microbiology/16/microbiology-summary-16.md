# Chapter 16: Disease and Epidemiology - Summary

## 16.1 The Language of Epidemiologists
*   **Epidemiology:** The study of where and when diseases occur in populations and how they are transmitted. Aims to control and prevent disease.
*   **Disease:** Any deviation from a state of health.
*   **Infectious Disease:** Caused by a pathogenic microorganism.
*   **Communicable Disease:** Spreads from one host to another, directly or indirectly.
*   **Contagious Disease:** A communicable disease that is easily spread.
*   **Noncommunicable Disease:** Does not spread from one host to another (e.g., tetanus, botulism).
*   **Incidence:** Number of new cases of a disease in a population during a specific time period. Indicates risk of contracting the disease.
*   **Prevalence:** Total number of existing cases (new and old) of a disease in a population at a specific time or during a specific period. Indicates overall impact of the disease.
*   **Morbidity:** Incidence of specific notifiable diseases. Morbidity rate = number of people affected / total population at risk.
*   **Mortality:** Number of deaths from a disease. Mortality rate = number of deaths / total population.
*   **Patterns of Disease Occurrence:**
    *   **Sporadic Disease:** Occurs occasionally and irregularly (e.g., typhoid fever in US).
    *   **Endemic Disease:** Constantly present in a population or geographic area at a relatively low level (e.g., common cold).
    *   **Epidemic:** Disease acquired by many people in a given area in a short time; significantly higher than usual incidence (e.g., influenza).
    *   **Pandemic:** An epidemic that occurs worldwide (e.g., COVID-19, AIDS).
*   **Etiology:** The cause of a disease.
*   **Koch's Postulates (Robert Koch):** Criteria used to establish that a specific microbe causes a specific disease.
    1.  The same pathogen must be present in every case of the disease.
    2.  The pathogen must be isolated from the diseased host and grown in pure culture.
    3.  The pathogen from the pure culture must cause the same disease when inoculated into a healthy, susceptible laboratory animal.
    4.  The pathogen must be re-isolated from the inoculated animal and shown to be the original organism.
    *   **Exceptions/Modifications:** Some pathogens can't be cultured, some diseases have multiple causes or nonspecific symptoms, ethical considerations for human hosts.

## 16.2 The Spread of Infection
*   **Reservoirs of Infection:** Continual sources of the disease-causing organism.
    *   **Human Reservoirs:**
        *   **Carriers:** Individuals who harbor pathogens and transmit them without exhibiting signs of illness (or during incubation/convalescence).
    *   **Animal Reservoirs:**
        *   **Zoonoses:** Diseases that occur primarily in animals but can be transmitted to humans (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease).
    *   **Nonliving Reservoirs:** Soil, water, food (often contaminated by animal or human feces).
*   **Modes of Transmission:**
    1.  **Contact Transmission:**
        *   **Direct Contact:** Person-to-person physical contact (touching, kissing, sexual intercourse).
        *   **Indirect Contact:** Spread by fomites (inanimate objects like towels, bedding, utensils, money).
        *   **Droplet Transmission:** Microbes spread in mucus droplets that travel short distances (<1 meter) via coughing, sneezing, talking.
    2.  **Vehicle Transmission:** Transmission by a medium.
        *   **Waterborne:** Contaminated water (e.g., cholera, giardiasis).
        *   **Foodborne:** Contaminated food (e.g., salmonellosis, food poisoning). Improperly cooked, poorly refrigerated, or prepared in unsanitary conditions.
        *   **Airborne:** Microbes spread in droplet nuclei or dust that travel >1 meter (e.g., tuberculosis, measles).
    3.  **Vector Transmission:** Animals that carry pathogens from one host to another.
        *   **Arthropods** are the most common vectors (e.g., fleas, ticks, mosquitoes).
        *   **Mechanical Vector:** Passive transport of pathogen on insect's feet or body.
        *   **Biological Vector:** Pathogen reproduces within the vector; transmission occurs when vector bites or defecates while feeding.

## 16.3 Nosocomial (Healthcare-Associated) Infections (HAIs)
*   Infections acquired as a result of a hospital stay or healthcare facility visit.
*   **Factors Contributing to HAIs:**
    1.  **Microorganisms in the Healthcare Environment:** Many pathogens present, some antibiotic-resistant.
    2.  **Compromised (Weakened) Host:** Patients often have impaired immune systems or underlying illnesses.
    3.  **Chain of Transmission:** Direct contact (staff-to-patient, patient-to-patient), indirect contact (fomites, ventilation systems).
*   **Common Types of HAIs:** Urinary tract infections (UTIs, often catheter-related), surgical site infections, lower respiratory infections (pneumonia), bloodstream infections (sepsis).
*   **Common Causative Agents:** *Staphylococcus aureus* (including MRSA), *Enterococcus* spp. (including VRE), *Clostridium difficile*, Gram-negative rods (e.g., *E. coli*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*).
*   **Control of HAIs:**
    *   Handwashing and hygiene.
    *   Aseptic techniques.
    *   Disinfection and sterilization of equipment.
    *   Isolation procedures.
    *   Antibiotic stewardship.
    *   Infection control committees and epidemiologists.

## 16.4 Public Health
*   Focuses on the health of populations rather than individuals.
*   **Role of Public Health Agencies:**
    *   **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):** National public health agency in the US. Collects and analyzes epidemiological information, publishes Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Conducts research, provides guidelines.
    *   **World Health Organization (WHO):** International agency. Directs and coordinates international health efforts, monitors global disease trends.
*   **Notifiable Infectious Diseases:** Diseases for which physicians are required by law to report cases to public health authorities. Helps monitor disease occurrence and trends.
*   **Epidemiological Studies:**
    *   **Descriptive Epidemiology:** Collects data about disease occurrence (person, place, time). Retrospective.
    *   **Analytical Epidemiology:** Analyzes a particular disease to determine its probable cause.
        *   **Case-Control Method:** Compares a group of people with the disease (cases) to a group without the disease (controls) to identify risk factors. Retrospective.
        *   **Cohort Method:** Compares two populations, one that has had contact with the agent causing a disease and another that has not. Prospective or retrospective.
    *   **Experimental Epidemiology:** Begins with a hypothesis about a particular disease; experiments to test the hypothesis are then conducted with a group of people (e.g., clinical trials for drugs/vaccines).
*   **Disease Prevention and Control Strategies:** Vaccination, vector control, sanitation, health education, quarantine/isolation, antimicrobial treatment.
