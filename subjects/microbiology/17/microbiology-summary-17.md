# Chapter 17: Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses - Summary

## 17.1 Physical Defenses
*   **Innate Immunity:** Defenses present at birth, always available, provide rapid responses. Non-specific (act against a wide range of pathogens).
*   **First Line of Defense:** Barriers that prevent pathogen entry.
    *   **Skin:**
        *   **Epidermis:** Outer, thinner portion, tightly packed cells, keratin (protective protein). Shedding removes microbes.
        *   **Dermis:** Inner, thicker portion.
        *   Dryness, low pH, and normal microbiota inhibit many pathogens.
    *   **Mucous Membranes:** Line respiratory, GI, genitourinary tracts, and conjunctiva.
        *   **Mucus:** Viscous glycoprotein layer that traps microbes.
        *   **Ciliary Escalator:** Cilia in respiratory tract propel mucus-trapped microbes upwards, away from lungs.
    *   **Lacrimal Apparatus:** Produces and drains tears; washing action, contains lysozyme.
    *   **Saliva:** Washes microbes from teeth and mouth, contains lysozyme, IgA.
    *   **Urine Flow:** Flushes microbes out of urethra.
    *   **Vaginal Secretions:** Move microbes out; acidic pH.
    *   **Peristalsis, Defecation, Vomiting:** Expel microbes from GI tract.
*   **Normal Microbiota (Normal Flora):**
    *   Compete with pathogens for nutrients and attachment sites (microbial antagonism/competitive exclusion).
    *   Produce substances harmful to pathogens (e.g., bacteriocins).
    *   Alter environmental conditions (e.g., pH, oxygen availability).
    *   **Probiotics:** Live microbial cultures administered to exert a beneficial effect.

## 17.2 Chemical Defenses
*   **Sebum:** Oily substance from sebaceous glands; forms protective film, lowers skin pH.
*   **Perspiration (Sweat):** Flushes microbes, contains lysozyme.
*   **Lysozyme:** Enzyme that breaks down peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls. Found in tears, saliva, nasal secretions, perspiration, tissue fluids.
*   **Gastric Juice:** Highly acidic (HCl, pH 1.2-3.0), enzymes; destroys most bacteria and toxins in the stomach.
*   **Vaginal Secretions:** Glycogen broken down by *Lactobacillus* spp. to lactic acid, creating acidic pH.
*   **Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs):** Short peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Produced by various cells. Examples: defensins, dermcidin, cathelicidins. Disrupt microbial membranes, interfere with DNA/RNA/protein synthesis.
*   **Iron-Binding Proteins:** Sequester iron, limiting its availability for microbial growth (e.g., transferrin, lactoferrin, ferritin, hemoglobin).
*   **Plasma Protein Mediators:**
    *   **Acute-Phase Proteins:** Produced by liver during inflammation (e.g., C-reactive protein, mannose-binding lectin).
    *   **Complement System:** (See section 17.4)
    *   **Cytokines:** (See section 17.3)

## 17.3 Cellular Defenses (Second Line of Defense)
*   **Blood Components:**
    *   **Plasma:** Liquid portion.
    *   **Formed Elements:** Cells and cell fragments.
        *   **Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells):** Transport O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>.
        *   **Leukocytes (White Blood Cells):** Involved in host defenses.
            *   **Granulocytes:** Have granules in cytoplasm.
                *   **Neutrophils (Polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMNs):** Most abundant WBC. Highly phagocytic, active in initial stages of infection. Can exit blood to enter infected tissue.
                *   **Basophils:** Release histamine and other mediators of inflammation. Involved in allergic responses.
                *   **Eosinophils:** Phagocytic (less effective than neutrophils). Produce toxic proteins against parasites (helminths). Involved in allergic reactions.
            *   **Agranulocytes:** Lack visible granules.
                *   **Monocytes:** Mature into macrophages when they leave blood and enter tissues. Highly phagocytic.
                *   **Dendritic Cells:** Phagocytic; important antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that initiate adaptive immune responses. Found in skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes.
                *   **Lymphocytes:** Key cells of adaptive immunity.
                    *   **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:** Part of innate immunity. Kill infected body cells and certain tumor cells. Release perforin (creates pores) and granzymes (induce apoptosis).
                    *   **T cells and B cells:** Involved in adaptive immunity (Chapter 18).
        *   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** Involved in blood clotting and inflammation.
*   **Phagocytosis ("Cell Eating"):** Ingestion of microbes or particulate matter by a cell (phagocyte).
    *   **Phagocytes:** Neutrophils, macrophages (fixed and wandering), dendritic cells, eosinophils.
    *   **Mechanism of Phagocytosis:**
        1.  **Chemotaxis:** Chemical attraction of phagocytes to microbes.
        2.  **Adherence:** Attachment of phagocyte to microbe (e.g., via PAMPs on microbe binding to TLRs on phagocyte). Opsonization (coating microbe with opsonins like antibodies or complement proteins) enhances adherence.
        3.  **Ingestion:** Pseudopods extend and engulf microbe, forming a phagosome (phagocytic vesicle).
        4.  **Formation of Phagolysosome:** Phagosome fuses with a lysosome.
        5.  **Digestion:** Microbe is digested by lysosomal enzymes (e.g., lysozyme, proteases, lipases, nucleases) and toxic oxygen products (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide).
        6.  **Formation of Residual Body:** Indigestible material remains.
        7.  **Discharge:** Residual body releases waste materials.
    *   **Evasion of Phagocytosis by Microbes:** Capsules, M protein, leukocidins, escape phagosome, prevent phagolysosome fusion, survive in phagolysosome.
*   **Inflammation:** Local defensive response to tissue injury (e.g., due to infection, physical damage).
    *   **Functions:** Destroy injurious agent, limit its spread, repair/replace damaged tissue.
    *   **Signs and Symptoms:** Redness, pain, heat, swelling (edema), sometimes loss of function.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Vasodilation and Increased Permeability of Blood Vessels:** Caused by release of histamine, kinins, prostaglandins, leukotrienes from damaged cells, mast cells, basophils. Results in increased blood flow (redness, heat) and leakage of fluid into tissues (edema, pain).
        2.  **Phagocyte Migration and Phagocytosis:**
            *   **Margination:** Phagocytes stick to endothelium of blood vessels.
            *   **Diapedesis (Extravasation):** Phagocytes squeeze between endothelial cells to leave blood and enter tissues.
            *   Chemotaxis guides phagocytes to site of injury. Neutrophils arrive first, then macrophages.
            *   Phagocytosis of microbes and debris. Pus formation (dead cells, body fluids).
        3.  **Tissue Repair:** Regeneration or fibrosis (scar tissue).
    *   **Acute Inflammation:** Short-term, intense.
    *   **Chronic Inflammation:** Long-lasting, less intense, can cause tissue damage.
*   **Fever:** Abnormally high body temperature. Systemic response.
    *   Hypothalamus (body's thermostat) is reset by pyrogens (e.g., bacterial toxins, IL-1 from phagocytes).
    *   **Benefits:** Intensifies effects of interferons, inhibits growth of some microbes, speeds up body reactions (repair).
    *   **Complications:** Tachycardia, acidosis, dehydration, seizures (if too high).
*   **Cytokines:** Soluble proteins or glycoproteins released by cells of the immune system that act as chemical messengers to regulate immune responses.
    *   Examples: Interleukins (ILs), Chemokines (induce chemotaxis), Interferons (IFNs), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).

## 17.4 The Complement System
*   A group of >30 serum proteins that "complement" the immune system in destroying microbes. Part of innate immunity but can be activated by adaptive immune responses.
*   **Activation Pathways (Cascade Reaction):**
    1.  **Classical Pathway:** Initiated by antigen-antibody complexes.
    2.  **Alternative Pathway:** Initiated by direct interaction of complement proteins (e.g., C3b) with microbial surfaces (PAMPs). Does not involve antibodies.
    3.  **Lectin Pathway:** Initiated when mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds to mannose on microbial surfaces, activating complement.
*   All pathways converge at the activation of C3, which is split into C3a and C3b.
*   **Outcomes of Complement Activation:**
    1.  **Cytolysis (Membrane Attack Complex - MAC):** C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9 proteins assemble to form a MAC, which creates pores in the microbial plasma membrane, leading to cell lysis.
    2.  **Opsonization:** C3b coats microbial surfaces, enhancing phagocytosis.
    3.  **Inflammation:** C3a and C5a bind to mast cells, triggering histamine release, which increases blood vessel permeability and attracts phagocytes.
*   **Regulation of Complement:** Host cells have regulatory proteins that prevent complement activation on their own surfaces.
*   **Evasion of Complement by Microbes:** Capsules, surface lipid-carbohydrates, enzymatic digestion of complement proteins.

## 17.5 Interferons (IFNs)
*   A class of cytokines with antiviral properties. Produced by virus-infected host cells.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β):** Produced by virus-infected cells. Diffuse to uninfected neighboring cells, inducing them to produce antiviral proteins (AVPs) that inhibit viral replication if those cells become infected. Cause many flu-like symptoms associated with viral infections.
    *   **Type II IFN (IFN-γ):** Produced by lymphocytes. Activates neutrophils and macrophages to kill bacteria.
*   Host-cell specific, but not virus-specific.
*   Recombinant IFNs are used therapeutically for some viral infections and cancers.
