# Chapter 18: Adaptive Specific Host Defenses - Summary

## 18.1 Overview of Adaptive Immunity
*   **Adaptive (Specific/Acquired) Immunity:** Develops after exposure to a specific antigen. Slower to respond than innate immunity but has memory.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Specificity:** Recognizes and targets specific pathogens or antigens.
    *   **Memory:** Remembers previously encountered antigens, allowing for a faster and stronger response upon subsequent exposure (anamnestic response).
    *   **Self-Tolerance:** Distinguishes between self (host) and non-self (foreign) antigens, normally doesn't attack host tissues.
*   **Dual Nature:**
    *   **Humoral Immunity (Antibody-Mediated Immunity):** Involves B lymphocytes (B cells) and antibodies. Effective against extracellular pathogens (bacteria, viruses before they enter cells, toxins).
    *   **Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI):** Involves T lymphocytes (T cells). Effective against intracellular pathogens (viruses inside cells, some bacteria), tumor cells, and transplanted tissues.
*   **Antigen (Ag):** A substance (usually protein or large polysaccharide) that causes the body to produce specific antibodies or sensitized T cells. Foreign to the host.
*   **Epitope (Antigenic Determinant):** Specific region on an antigen that an antibody or T cell receptor recognizes and binds to.
*   **Hapten:** A small molecule that is antigenic only when attached to a larger carrier molecule (e.g., a protein).

## 18.2 B Lymphocytes and Humoral Immunity
*   **B Cells (B Lymphocytes):** Develop and mature in bone marrow. Display B cell receptors (BCRs) on their surface, which are membrane-bound antibodies (IgM and IgD) that recognize specific antigens.
*   **Activation of B Cells (T-dependent Antigens):**
    1.  BCR binds to a specific epitope on an antigen.
    2.  B cell internalizes and processes the antigen, presenting fragments on its surface via MHC Class II molecules.
    3.  A T helper cell (T<sub>H</sub> cell, specifically T<sub>H</sub>2) that recognizes the same antigen (presented by an APC like a macrophage or dendritic cell, or by the B cell itself) interacts with the B cell.
    4.  T<sub>H</sub> cell releases cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-6) that co-stimulate the B cell.
    5.  Activated B cell proliferates (clonal expansion) and differentiates into:
        *   **Plasma Cells:** Antibody-secreting cells. Short-lived.
        *   **Memory B Cells:** Long-lived, responsible for memory response.
*   **T-Independent Antigens:** Some antigens (e.g., polysaccharides with repeating epitopes, LPS) can directly activate B cells without T<sub>H</sub> cell help. Weaker immune response, primarily IgM, little memory.
*   **Antibodies (Immunoglobulins, Ig):**
    *   Soluble proteins produced by plasma cells in response to an antigen. Circulate in blood and lymph, found on mucosal surfaces.
    *   **Structure:** Y-shaped molecule composed of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains, linked by disulfide bonds.
        *   **Variable (V) Regions:** At the tips of the Y (Fab region - fragment antigen-binding). Form the antigen-binding sites. Specificity for antigen.
        *   **Constant (C) Regions:** Stem of the Y (Fc region - fragment crystallizable). Determines the antibody class and effector functions (e.g., complement activation, binding to phagocytes).
    *   **Antibody Classes (Isotypes):** Based on C region of heavy chain.
        *   **IgG:** Monomer. Most abundant in serum (80%). Crosses placenta (passive immunity to fetus). Activates complement, enhances phagocytosis (opsonin), neutralizes toxins and viruses. Long-lived.
        *   **IgM:** Pentamer (5 monomers joined by J chain). First antibody produced during primary immune response. Effective agglutinating agent, activates complement. Found on B cell surface as monomer (BCR).
        *   **IgA:** Dimer (in secretions) or monomer (in serum). Most abundant in mucous secretions (saliva, tears, mucus, breast milk - secretory IgA). Prevents pathogen attachment to mucosal surfaces.
        *   **IgD:** Monomer. Found on B cell surfaces as BCR, involved in B cell activation. Low levels in serum.
        *   **IgE:** Monomer. Binds to mast cells and basophils. Involved in allergic reactions (triggers histamine release) and defense against parasitic worms. Low levels in serum.
*   **Mechanisms of Antibody Action (Antigen-Antibody Binding):**
    *   **Agglutination:** Antibodies cause clumping of particulate antigens (e.g., bacteria, RBCs), making them easier to phagocytose.
    *   **Opsonization:** Coating of antigens with antibodies (or complement) enhances phagocytosis.
    *   **Neutralization:** Antibodies block adhesion of bacteria/viruses to host cells, or block a toxin's active site.
    *   **Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC):** Antibodies coat a target cell (e.g., parasite, tumor cell); Fc regions bind to receptors on NK cells, eosinophils, or macrophages, which then release lytic enzymes to kill the target.
    *   **Complement Activation (Classical Pathway):** IgG or IgM antibodies bind to antigen, activating C1 and initiating the complement cascade, leading to cytolysis, inflammation, and opsonization.
*   **Clonal Selection and Expansion:** When a B cell (or T cell) encounters its specific antigen, it is stimulated to proliferate (make clones) and differentiate.
*   **Immunological Memory:**
    *   **Primary Response:** First exposure to an antigen. Slow rise in IgM, followed by IgG. Memory cells produced.
    *   **Secondary (Anamnestic/Memory) Response:** Subsequent exposure to the same antigen. Faster, stronger, and longer-lasting response, primarily IgG, due to activation of memory cells.

## 18.3 T Lymphocytes and Cell-Mediated Immunity
*   **T Cells (T Lymphocytes):** Develop in bone marrow, mature in the thymus. Have T Cell Receptors (TCRs) on their surface that recognize specific antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules on other cells.
*   **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC):**
    *   Glycoproteins on cell surfaces that present antigen fragments to T cells. Also known as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) in humans.
    *   **MHC Class I:** Found on all nucleated body cells. Present endogenous antigens (e.g., viral proteins synthesized within the cell, tumor antigens) to CD8+ T cells (Cytotoxic T cells).
    *   **MHC Class II:** Found on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) like macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Present exogenous antigens (phagocytosed from outside the cell) to CD4+ T cells (Helper T cells).
*   **Types of T Cells:**
    *   **Helper T Cells (T<sub>H</sub> Cells, CD4+ T Cells):**
        *   Recognize antigen presented on MHC Class II molecules by APCs.
        *   Activated T<sub>H</sub> cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T<sub>H</sub> cells and memory T<sub>H</sub> cells.
        *   Secrete cytokines that help activate B cells, cytotoxic T cells, macrophages, and other immune cells.
        *   Subsets: T<sub>H</sub>1 (promote CMI, activate macrophages), T<sub>H</sub>2 (promote humoral immunity, B cell activation, eosinophil activity), T<sub>H</sub>17 (promote inflammation, recruit neutrophils), Regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>).
    *   **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs, CD8+ T Cells):**
        *   Recognize endogenous antigens presented on MHC Class I molecules by infected body cells or tumor cells.
        *   Activated CTLs proliferate and differentiate into effector CTLs and memory CTLs.
        *   Effector CTLs kill target cells by releasing:
            *   **Perforin:** Creates pores in target cell membrane.
            *   **Granzymes:** Proteases that enter through pores and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the target cell.
    *   **Regulatory T Cells (T<sub>reg</sub> Cells, Suppressor T Cells):**
        *   Usually CD4+ (also express CD25 and FOXP3).
        *   Suppress immune responses, maintain self-tolerance, prevent autoimmune reactions.
*   **Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs):**
    *   Engulf and process antigens, then present fragments on their surface with MHC molecules to T cells.
    *   **Dendritic Cells:** Most potent APCs; initiate primary T cell responses.
    *   **Macrophages:** Phagocytic; present antigens to T<sub>H</sub> cells, which then activate the macrophage to enhance its killing ability.
    *   **B Cells:** Present antigens to T<sub>H</sub> cells for B cell activation.
*   **Activation of T Cells:** Requires antigen presentation by MHC and co-stimulatory signals from APCs.
*   **Clonal Deletion (Negative Selection):** Process in thymus (for T cells) and bone marrow (for B cells) that eliminates self-reactive lymphocytes, crucial for self-tolerance.

## 18.4 Types of Adaptive Immunity
*   **Naturally Acquired Active Immunity:** Develops after natural exposure to antigens (infection), leading to antibody and memory cell production. Long-lasting.
*   **Naturally Acquired Passive Immunity:** Transfer of antibodies from mother to offspring.
    *   IgG crosses placenta to fetus.
    *   IgA in breast milk protects infant's GI tract.
    *   Short-lived (no memory cells produced by recipient).
*   **Artificially Acquired Active Immunity:** Develops after intentional exposure to antigens via vaccination (immunization). Stimulates antibody and memory cell production. Long-lasting.
*   **Artificially Acquired Passive Immunity:** Injection of pre-formed antibodies (antiserum or immune globulin) from an immune individual or animal. Provides immediate but short-term protection (no memory). Used for post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment (e.g., tetanus antitoxin, rabies immune globulin).
