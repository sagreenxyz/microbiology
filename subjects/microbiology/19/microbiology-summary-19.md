# Chapter 19: Diseases of the Immune System - Summary

## 19.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions
*   **Hypersensitivity:** An exaggerated or inappropriate immune response to an antigen (allergen) that results in tissue damage.
*   **Four Types (Gell and Coombs Classification):**
    *   **Type I (Anaphylactic/Immediate) Hypersensitivity:**
        *   Occurs within minutes of re-exposure to an allergen.
        *   Mediated by IgE antibodies.
        *   **Sensitization:** Initial exposure to allergen causes plasma cells to produce IgE, which binds to Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils.
        *   **Subsequent Exposure:** Allergen binds to IgE on sensitized mast cells/basophils, causing degranulation and release of mediators (histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins).
        *   **Effects of Mediators:** Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, mucus secretion.
        *   **Localized Anaphylaxis:** Symptoms depend on route of entry (e.g., hay fever - upper respiratory; asthma - lower respiratory; hives - skin; food allergies - GI).
        *   **Systemic Anaphylaxis (Anaphylactic Shock):** Severe, life-threatening. Allergen enters bloodstream, causes widespread vasodilation, drastic drop in blood pressure, airway constriction. Requires immediate epinephrine.
        *   **Diagnosis:** Skin tests (wheal-and-flare reaction).
        *   **Treatment/Prevention:** Antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine, desensitization (allergy shots - induce IgG blocking antibodies).
    *   **Type II (Cytotoxic) Hypersensitivity:**
        *   Mediated by IgG or IgM antibodies directed against antigens on host cell surfaces.
        *   Leads to cell destruction via complement activation (MAC lysis) or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
        *   Examples:
            *   **Transfusion Reactions (ABO blood group incompatibility):** Antibodies against A or B antigens on transfused RBCs cause agglutination and lysis.
            *   **Rh Incompatibility (Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn - HDN):** Rh<sup>-</sup> mother sensitized to Rh<sup>+</sup> fetal RBCs produces anti-Rh IgG, which can cross placenta and damage RBCs of subsequent Rh<sup>+</sup> fetuses. Prevented by RhoGAM (anti-Rh antibodies) given to mother.
            *   **Drug-Induced Cytotoxic Reactions:** Drugs (haptens) bind to cells, become antigenic (e.g., thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia).
    *   **Type III (Immune Complex) Hypersensitivity:**
        *   Mediated by IgG antibodies forming immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes) that are deposited in tissues or blood vessel walls.
        *   Immune complexes activate complement, leading to inflammation and tissue damage (attraction of neutrophils, release of enzymes).
        *   Examples:
            *   **Glomerulonephritis:** Immune complexes deposited in kidney glomeruli.
            *   **Serum Sickness:** Systemic reaction to foreign serum proteins.
            *   **Arthus Reaction:** Localized reaction at site of injected antigen.
            *   Autoimmune diseases like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis.
    *   **Type IV (Delayed-Type/Cell-Mediated) Hypersensitivity:**
        *   Mediated by T cells (T<sub>H</sub>1 cells and CTLs), not antibodies.
        *   Delayed reaction (24-72 hours after exposure) due to time for T cell migration and activation.
        *   **Sensitization:** Initial exposure to antigen leads to sensitization of T cells.
        *   **Subsequent Exposure:** Antigen presented to sensitized T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, which release cytokines, activating macrophages and CTLs, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.
        *   Examples:
            *   **Tuberculin Skin Test (PPD test):** Detects previous exposure to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.
            *   **Contact Dermatitis:** Allergic reaction to substances like poison ivy, nickel, cosmetics. Haptens combine with skin proteins.
            *   **Graft Rejection:** (See section 19.3)

## 19.2 Autoimmune Diseases
*   **Autoimmunity:** Loss of self-tolerance, leading to an immune response against one's own tissues.
*   **Mechanisms:** Complex and not fully understood. May involve genetic predisposition, environmental factors (e.g., infections triggering cross-reactivity), defects in clonal deletion or T<sub>reg</sub> function.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Systemic Autoimmune Diseases:**
        *   **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** Production of autoantibodies against DNA, histones, other self-components. Immune complex deposition in multiple organs.
        *   **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** Autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor) against IgG Fc region. Immune complexes deposited in joints, causing chronic inflammation and cartilage/bone destruction.
    *   **Organ-Specific Autoimmune Diseases:**
        *   **Graves' Disease:** Autoantibodies stimulate thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors, causing hyperthyroidism. (Type II-like mechanism, but stimulatory).
        *   **Hashimoto's Thyroiditis:** T cells and autoantibodies attack thyroid tissue, causing hypothyroidism.
        *   **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus:** T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in pancreas.
        *   **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** T cell-mediated destruction of myelin sheath of nerve cells.
        *   **Myasthenia Gravis:** Autoantibodies block acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions, causing muscle weakness.
*   **Treatment:** Immunosuppressive drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, sometimes plasmapheresis or specific antibody therapies.

## 19.3 Transplantation and Graft Rejection
*   **Transplantation:** Transfer of organs or tissues.
*   **Histocompatibility Antigens:** Primarily MHC (HLA) molecules. Differences in MHC between donor and recipient are major cause of rejection.
*   **Graft Rejection:** Immune response (primarily T cell-mediated, especially CTLs) against foreign antigens (MHC) on transplanted tissue.
    *   **Types of Grafts:**
        *   **Autograft:** From one part of the body to another on the same individual (no rejection).
        *   **Isograft (Syngeneic Graft):** Between genetically identical individuals (identical twins) (no rejection).
        *   **Allograft:** Between genetically different individuals of the same species (most common type, requires immunosuppression).
        *   **Xenograft (Xenotransplantation):** Between individuals of different species (e.g., pig heart valve to human). High risk of rejection.
*   **Prevention of Rejection:**
    *   **HLA Typing (Tissue Typing):** Matching donor and recipient MHC antigens as closely as possible.
    *   **Immunosuppressive Drugs:** To prevent T cell activation and proliferation (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs). Increases susceptibility to infections and cancer.
*   **Graft-versus-Host (GVH) Disease:** Can occur in bone marrow transplants. Immunocompetent T cells in the graft attack the recipient's tissues.

## 19.4 Immunodeficiencies
*   Absence or defect in one or more components of the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and cancer.
*   **Primary Immunodeficiencies (Congenital):** Genetically determined, present at birth.
    *   **B Cell Deficiencies:**
        *   **X-linked (Bruton's) Agammaglobulinemia:** Defect in B cell maturation; lack of antibodies. Recurrent bacterial infections.
        *   **Selective IgA Deficiency:** Most common primary immunodeficiency. Low levels of IgA. Often asymptomatic or mild recurrent mucosal infections.
    *   **T Cell Deficiencies:**
        *   **DiGeorge Syndrome (Thymic Aplasia):** Defective thymus development; lack of mature T cells. Susceptible to viral, fungal, protozoal infections.
    *   **Combined B and T Cell Deficiencies:**
        *   **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID):** Group of disorders with defects in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. "Bubble boy" disease. Highly susceptible to all types of infections. Requires bone marrow transplant or gene therapy.
    *   **Complement Deficiencies:** Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, especially *Neisseria*.
    *   **Phagocytic Deficiencies:** (e.g., Chronic Granulomatous Disease - CGD): Impaired ability of phagocytes to kill ingested microbes.
*   **Secondary Immunodeficiencies (Acquired):** Develop later in life due to external factors. More common than primary.
    *   **Causes:**
        *   **Infections:** e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection leading to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - targets CD4+ T cells.
        *   **Malignancies:** e.g., leukemia, lymphoma.
        *   **Immunosuppressive Drugs:** Used for transplantation or autoimmune diseases.
        *   **Malnutrition.**
        *   **Stress.**
        *   **Aging.**
*   **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):**
    *   Caused by HIV, a retrovirus that infects and destroys CD4+ T cells (helper T cells).
    *   Progressive decline in immune function, leading to opportunistic infections and cancers.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Detection of anti-HIV antibodies, HIV RNA (viral load), CD4+ T cell count.
    *   **Treatment:** Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) - combination of drugs targeting different stages of HIV life cycle. Does not cure but can suppress viral replication and prolong life.
