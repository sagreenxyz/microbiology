# Chapter 20: Laboratory Analysis of the Immune Response - Summary

## 20.1 Serology and Immunoassays
*   **Serology:** The study of antigen-antibody reactions in vitro (in laboratory settings). Serum (plasma without clotting factors) is often used as it contains antibodies.
*   **Immunoassays:** Laboratory tests that use antigen-antibody reactions to detect and quantify specific antigens or antibodies.
*   **Polyclonal Antibodies:** Produced by injecting an animal with an antigen; the resulting serum contains a mixture of antibodies produced by different B cell clones, recognizing various epitopes on the antigen.
*   **Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs):** Homogeneous population of antibodies produced by a single B cell clone, all recognizing the same specific epitope.
    *   **Hybridoma Technology (KÃ¶hler and Milstein):**
        1.  Inject animal (e.g., mouse) with antigen.
        2.  Isolate antibody-producing B cells (plasma cells) from spleen.
        3.  Fuse B cells with immortal myeloma cells (cancerous B cells) to create hybridoma cells.
        4.  Select and culture hybridoma cells that produce the desired antibody.
    *   **Applications of mAbs:** Diagnostics (e.g., pregnancy tests, disease detection), therapeutics (e.g., cancer treatment, autoimmune diseases), research.
    *   **Types of Therapeutic mAbs:** Murine (-omab), Chimeric (-ximab), Humanized (-zumab), Fully Human (-umab).

## 20.2 Precipitation Reactions
*   Involve the reaction of soluble antigens with soluble antibodies (IgG or IgM) to form large, interlocking aggregates called precipitates, which are visible.
*   Occur optimally when antigen and antibody concentrations are in equivalence (optimal ratio). Excess of either can inhibit precipitation (prozone or postzone effect).
*   **Precipitin Ring Test:** Soluble antigen solution is layered over an antibody solution in a narrow tube. A precipitate ring forms at the zone of equivalence.
*   **Immunodiffusion Tests (Ouchterlony Test):**
    *   Antigens and antibodies diffuse through an agar gel from separate wells.
    *   Precipitin lines form where they meet in optimal proportions.
    *   Used to determine relatedness of antigens (identity, non-identity, partial identity).
*   **Radial Immunodiffusion (RID):** Antibody is incorporated into the agar; antigen is added to wells. Antigen diffuses out, forming a precipitin ring. Diameter of the ring is proportional to antigen concentration. Quantitative.

## 20.3 Agglutination Reactions
*   Involve the reaction of antibodies with particulate antigens (e.g., cells like bacteria or RBCs, or latex particles coated with antigen) to form visible clumps (agglutinates).
*   More sensitive than precipitation reactions for detecting small amounts of antibody.
*   **Direct Agglutination Tests:** Detect antibodies against particulate antigens on cells.
    *   **Hemagglutination:** Agglutination of red blood cells. Used in blood typing (ABO).
    *   **Bacterial Agglutination:** Used to identify bacteria (serotyping) or detect patient antibodies (e.g., Widal test for typhoid fever).
    *   **Titer:** The highest dilution of serum that still causes agglutination. Indicates antibody concentration.
*   **Indirect (Passive) Agglutination Tests:** Soluble antigens are adsorbed onto particles (e.g., latex beads, RBCs). Antibodies then agglutinate these antigen-coated particles.
*   **Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Test:** Used to detect antibodies against certain viruses that naturally agglutinate RBCs (e.g., influenza, measles). If patient serum contains antibodies to the virus, they will neutralize the virus and prevent hemagglutination.

## 20.4 Neutralization Reactions
*   Antigen-antibody reaction where antibodies block the harmful effects of a bacterial exotoxin or a virus.
*   **Toxin Neutralization:** Antitoxin antibodies bind to toxin, preventing it from damaging host cells. Used in diagnosis (e.g., identifying toxin-producing bacteria) or therapy.
*   **Viral Neutralization:** Antibodies bind to viral surface proteins, preventing attachment to host cells. Used to identify viruses or detect antiviral antibodies.

## 20.5 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) / Enzyme Immunoassays (EIA)
*   Highly sensitive and versatile tests that use enzyme-labeled antibodies or antigens to detect and quantify antigens or antibodies.
*   Enzyme reacts with a substrate to produce a colored product, which is measured.
*   **Direct ELISA:**
    1.  Antigen is adsorbed to well.
    2.  Enzyme-labeled antibody specific for the antigen is added.
    3.  Substrate is added; color change indicates presence of antigen.
    *   Used to detect antigens.
*   **Indirect ELISA:**
    1.  Known antigen is adsorbed to well.
    2.  Patient serum (containing primary antibody) is added.
    3.  Enzyme-labeled secondary antibody (anti-human IgG) is added, binds to primary antibody.
    4.  Substrate is added; color change indicates presence of primary antibody in patient serum.
    *   Used to detect antibodies (e.g., HIV screening).
*   **Sandwich (Capture) ELISA:**
    1.  Monoclonal antibody (capture antibody) is adsorbed to well.
    2.  Test sample (containing antigen) is added; antigen binds to capture antibody.
    3.  Enzyme-labeled second monoclonal antibody (detection antibody, specific for a different epitope on the antigen) is added.
    4.  Substrate is added; color change indicates presence of antigen.
    *   Used to detect antigens (often for hormones, cytokines, viral antigens).
*   **Competitive ELISA:** Antigen in sample competes with enzyme-labeled antigen for binding to a limited amount of antibody coated on the well. Less color = more antigen in sample.

## 20.6 Other Immunological Assays
*   **Complement Fixation Test:**
    *   Detects small amounts of antibody.
    *   Two stages:
        1.  Test system: Patient serum (heat-inactivated to destroy its complement) is mixed with known antigen and guinea pig complement. If antibody is present, antigen-antibody complexes form and "fix" (consume) complement.
        2.  Indicator system: Sheep RBCs and anti-sheep RBC antibodies are added.
            *   If complement was fixed in stage 1 (positive test, antibody present), no complement is left to lyse RBCs -> RBCs remain intact.
            *   If complement was not fixed (negative test, antibody absent), complement lyses RBCs -> hemolysis.
*   **Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) / Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Identifies and sorts cells based on their characteristics (size, granularity) and fluorescent labels.
    *   Cells labeled with fluorescent antibodies (specific for cell surface markers, e.g., CD4, CD8) pass through a laser beam.
    *   Detects fluorescence and light scatter, allowing quantification and separation of cell populations.
    *   Used for T cell counts (CD4 count in HIV), immunophenotyping of leukemias/lymphomas.
*   **Immunofluorescence (Fluorescent Antibody - FA) Techniques:**
    *   Use antibodies labeled with fluorescent dyes (fluorochromes) to detect antigens in cells or tissues.
    *   **Direct FA:** Fluorescently labeled antibody binds directly to the antigen.
    *   **Indirect FA:** Unlabeled primary antibody binds to antigen; fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (anti-primary antibody) binds to the primary antibody. More sensitive.
*   **Western Blotting (Immunoblotting):** (Covered in Ch 12, but relevant here for antibody detection)
    *   Proteins (antigens) are separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane.
    *   Membrane is probed with patient serum (primary antibody).
    *   Enzyme-labeled secondary antibody (anti-human Ig) is added.
    *   Substrate is added; colored band indicates presence of antibody to specific protein.
    *   Used as a confirmatory test for HIV (detects antibodies to specific HIV proteins).
