# Chapter 21: Skin and Eye Infections - Summary

## 21.1 Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the Skin and Eyes
*   **Skin:** Largest organ, physical barrier.
    *   **Epidermis:** Outer layer, keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.
    *   **Dermis:** Inner layer, connective tissue, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands.
    *   **Hypodermis (Subcutaneous layer):** Fat and connective tissue.
    *   **Defenses:** Keratin, dryness, low pH (sebum, sweat), lysozyme in sweat, antimicrobial peptides, shedding of cells, normal microbiota.
    *   **Normal Microbiota of Skin:** Varies by location. Predominantly Gram-positive bacteria.
        *   *Staphylococcus epidermidis* (most common).
        *   *Propionibacterium acnes* (anaerobic, in hair follicles).
        *   *Corynebacterium* spp. (diphtheroids).
        *   Yeasts like *Malassezia*.
*   **Eyes:**
    *   **Structures:** Eyelids, eyelashes, conjunctiva (mucous membrane lining eyelids and covering white of eye), cornea (transparent outer layer), lacrimal apparatus (produces tears).
    *   **Defenses:** Tears (washing action, lysozyme, lactoferrin, IgA), blinking.
    *   **Normal Microbiota of Eyes:** Sparse, similar to skin microbiota.

## 21.2 Bacterial Infections of the Skin
*   **Staphylococcal Skin Infections:**
    *   *Staphylococcus aureus*: Most pathogenic. Produces coagulase, toxins (leukocidins, exfoliative toxin, enterotoxins, TSST-1). Often antibiotic-resistant (MRSA).
        *   **Folliculitis:** Infection of hair follicles (pimples).
        *   **Sty (Hordeolum):** Folliculitis of an eyelash.
        *   **Furuncle (Boil):** Abscess; localized region of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue.
        *   **Carbuncle:** Hard, round deep inflammation of tissue under the skin; aggregation of furuncles.
        *   **Impetigo:** Superficial, crusting sores, highly contagious. Common in children. Can also be caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*.
        *   **Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSS):** Caused by exfoliative toxin from *S. aureus*. Separation of epidermis.
        *   **Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS):** Fever, rash, shock due to TSST-1.
    *   *Staphylococcus epidermidis*: Coagulase-negative. Common on skin, opportunistic pathogen (e.g., infections of catheters, implants).
*   **Streptococcal Skin Infections:**
    *   *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus - GAS): Produces hemolysins, M protein, hyaluronidase, streptokinases, DNases.
        *   **Impetigo:** (Also caused by *S. aureus*).
        *   **Erysipelas:** Infection of dermal layer, reddish patches with raised margins.
        *   **Cellulitis:** Infection of dermis and subcutaneous tissue, diffuse inflammation.
        *   **Necrotizing Fasciitis ("Flesh-eating bacteria"):** Rapidly spreading infection causing destruction of muscle and fat tissue. Exotoxins (e.g., Exotoxin A - superantigen) contribute.
        *   **Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS):** Similar to staphylococcal TSS.
*   **Pseudomonas Infections:**
    *   *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*: Gram-negative rod, opportunistic pathogen. Produces exotoxins, endotoxin, biofilms. Found in soil, water. Often antibiotic-resistant.
        *   **Pseudomonas dermatitis:** Rash associated with swimming pools, hot tubs.
        *   **Otitis Externa ("Swimmer's ear").**
        *   Infections of burns, wounds. Can cause blue-green pus (pyocyanin pigment).
*   **Acne:**
    *   *Propionibacterium acnes* (now *Cutibacterium acnes*): Anaerobic, metabolizes sebum in hair follicles.
    *   Inflammatory response to bacterial antigens and fatty acids.
    *   Comedonal (mild), inflammatory (moderate), nodular cystic (severe).
*   **Anthrax (Cutaneous):**
    *   *Bacillus anthracis*: Gram-positive, endospore-forming rod.
    *   Endospores enter skin through minor cuts, form a black eschar (scab). Can progress to systemic infection.
