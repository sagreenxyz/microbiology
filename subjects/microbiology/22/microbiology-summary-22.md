# Chapter 22: Respiratory System Infections - Summary

## 22.1 Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the Respiratory System
*   **Upper Respiratory System:** Nose, pharynx (throat), middle ear, Eustachian tubes, larynx (voice box).
    *   **Defenses:** Nasal hairs, ciliary escalator, mucus, lysozyme in mucus, normal microbiota.
    *   **Normal Microbiota:** Diverse, includes *Staphylococcus*, *Streptococcus*, *Haemophilus*, diphtheroids. Can include potential pathogens.
*   **Lower Respiratory System:** Trachea (windpipe), bronchial tubes, alveoli (air sacs in lungs).
    *   **Defenses:** Ciliary escalator, alveolar macrophages, IgA in secretions.
    *   **Normally sterile** or nearly sterile due to efficient defense mechanisms.

## 22.2 Bacterial Infections of the Upper Respiratory System
*   **Streptococcal Pharyngitis (Strep Throat):**
    *   Caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus - GAS).
    *   Symptoms: Inflammation of pharynx, fever, tonsillitis, swollen lymph nodes.
    *   Diagnosis: Rapid strep test (antigen detection), throat culture.
    *   Complications (if untreated): Scarlet fever (erythrogenic toxin), acute rheumatic fever (autoimmune, affects heart, joints), acute glomerulonephritis.
*   **Scarlet Fever:**
    *   Complication of strep throat caused by GAS strains producing erythrogenic toxin.
    *   Symptoms: Pinkish-red rash, high fever, "strawberry tongue."
*   **Diphtheria:**
    *   Caused by *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* (Gram-positive rod).
    *   Produces diphtheria toxin (A-B exotoxin) that inhibits protein synthesis.
    *   Symptoms: Sore throat, fever, malaise, swelling of neck, formation of a tough grayish pseudomembrane in throat (can block airway).
    *   Prevented by DTaP/Tdap vaccine (diphtheria toxoid).
*   **Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection):**
    *   Inflammation of the middle ear, often a complication of common cold or pharyngitis.
    *   Common causes: *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae* (non-type b), *Moraxella catarrhalis*, *S. pyogenes*.
    *   Pus accumulation puts pressure on eardrum.
*   **Bacterial Sinusitis:** Inflammation of sinuses, often follows a viral URI. Similar causative agents as otitis media.

## 22.3 Viral Infections of the Upper Respiratory System
*   **Common Cold (Rhinitis):**
    *   Most common infectious disease.
    *   Caused by over 200 different viruses, primarily Rhinoviruses (most common) and Coronaviruses. Also adenoviruses, enteroviruses.
    *   Symptoms: Sneezing, nasal discharge, congestion, sore throat. Usually no fever.
    *   Transmission: Respiratory droplets, direct contact, fomites.
*   **Viral Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis:** Often caused by adenoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses.
*   **Laryngitis:** Inflammation of the larynx.
*   **Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis):** Common in young children, often viral (parainfluenza viruses). Barking cough, stridor.

## 22.4 Bacterial Infections of the Lower Respiratory System
*   **Pertussis (Whooping Cough):**
    *   Caused by *Bordetella pertussis* (Gram-negative coccobacillus).
    *   Produces toxins (e.g., pertussis toxin, tracheal cytotoxin). Attaches to ciliated cells in trachea, impeding ciliary action and destroying cells.
    *   **Stages:**
        1.  **Catarrhal stage:** Resembles common cold. Highly contagious.
        2.  **Paroxysmal stage:** Prolonged coughing fits with characteristic "whoop" (gasp for air). Vomiting.
        3.  **Convalescence stage:** Gradual recovery.
    *   Prevented by DTaP/Tdap vaccine (acellular pertussis components).
*   **Tuberculosis (TB):**
    *   Caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (acid-fast rod, obligate aerobe).
    *   Transmitted by inhalation of airborne droplets.
    *   Pathogenesis: Inhaled bacilli are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages but can survive and multiply intracellularly. Immune response leads to formation of tubercles (granulomas) that can wall off the bacteria.
    *   **Latent TB Infection (LTBI):** Bacteria remain dormant in tubercles; no symptoms, not infectious. Can reactivate.
    *   **Active TB Disease:** Bacteria multiply, tubercles expand and may rupture (caseous necrosis, liquefaction), spreading bacteria. Symptoms: cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, hemoptysis.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Tuberculin skin test (PPD), Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs), chest X-ray, sputum smear (acid-fast stain), culture, NAATs.
    *   **Treatment:** Prolonged multi-drug therapy (e.g., isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) to prevent resistance.
    *   **BCG vaccine:** Live attenuated strain of *M. bovis*; variable effectiveness.
*   **Bacterial Pneumonias:** Inflammation of the lungs, often involving alveoli filling with fluid.
    *   **Typical Pneumonia:**
        *   ***Streptococcus pneumoniae* (Pneumococcal Pneumonia):** Most common cause. Gram-positive diplococcus, capsule is major virulence factor. Symptoms: high fever, chills, cough with rusty sputum, chest pain. Vaccine available (PPSV23, PCV13/15/20).
        *   ***Haemophilus influenzae* Pneumonia:** Gram-negative coccobacillus. Common in elderly or those with chronic respiratory disease. Hib vaccine for type b (meningitis) does not prevent pneumonia by other strains.
        *   ***Klebsiella pneumoniae* Pneumonia:** Gram-negative rod, large capsule. Often hospital-acquired, can cause destructive lung damage (currant jelly sputum).
        *   ***Staphylococcus aureus* Pneumonia:** Can be a complication of influenza or other infections, or hospital-acquired (MRSA).
    *   **Atypical Pneumonia (Walking Pneumonia):** Milder symptoms, different causative agents.
        *   ***Mycoplasma pneumoniae* Pneumonia:** Smallest free-living bacteria, lack cell walls. Common in children and young adults. Gradual onset, low-grade fever, persistent cough.
        *   ***Chlamydophila pneumoniae* Pneumonia:** Obligate intracellular bacterium. Mild.
        *   ***Legionella pneumophila* (Legionellosis/Legionnaires' Disease):** Gram-negative rod. Found in water systems (e.g., air conditioners, humidifiers). Transmitted by inhaling aerosols, not person-to-person. High fever, cough. Can also cause Pontiac fever (milder, flu-like).
    *   **Psittacosis (Ornithosis):** Caused by *Chlamydophila psittaci*. Transmitted from infected birds.
    *   **Q Fever:** Caused by *Coxiella burnetii* (obligate intracellular). Transmitted from livestock (inhalation of aerosols from placentas, milk, urine, feces).
*   **Melioidosis:** Caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. Found in soil/water in SE Asia, N Australia. Pneumonia is common presentation.

## 22.5 Viral Infections of the Lower Respiratory System
*   **Influenza (Flu):**
    *   Caused by Influenza viruses (Orthomyxoviridae family, RNA virus). Types A, B, C. Type A causes most epidemics/pandemics.
    *   **Surface Antigens:** Hemagglutinin (HA) spikes (for attachment to host cells) and Neuraminidase (NA) spikes (for release of new virions).
    *   **Antigenic Drift:** Minor changes in HA/NA genes due to point mutations. Leads to seasonal epidemics.
    *   **Antigenic Shift:** Major changes in HA/NA genes due to genetic reassortment between different viral strains (e.g., human and animal strains infecting the same cell). Can lead to pandemics.
    *   Symptoms: Fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, cough, fatigue.
    *   Complications: Viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia.
    *   Treatment: Antivirals (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir - neuraminidase inhibitors) if given early.
    *   Prevention: Annual vaccination.
*   **Viral Pneumonia:** Can be a complication of influenza, measles, chickenpox. Also caused by:
    *   **Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV):** Most common cause of viral respiratory disease in infants and young children (bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Causes syncytia formation.
    *   **Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV):** Similar to RSV.
    *   **Adenoviruses, Parainfluenza viruses.**
    *   **Coronaviruses:**
        *   **Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1):** Emerged in 2002-2003.
        *   **Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV):** Emerged in 2012.
        *   **COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2):** Emerged in 2019, caused global pandemic.
*   **Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS):**
    *   Caused by Hantaviruses. Transmitted by inhalation of virus from dried rodent urine, feces, or saliva.
    *   Rapid onset of fever, muscle aches, then severe respiratory distress, fluid in lungs. High mortality.

## 22.6 Fungal and Parasitic Infections of the Respiratory System
*   **Fungal Pneumonias:** Often opportunistic, more common in immunocompromised individuals.
