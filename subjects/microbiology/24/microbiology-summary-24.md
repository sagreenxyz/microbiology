# Chapter 24: Digestive System Infections - Summary

## 24.1 Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the Digestive System
*   **Organs:** Mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), large intestine (colon), rectum, anus. Accessory organs: teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas.
*   **Functions:** Ingestion, digestion (mechanical and chemical), absorption of nutrients, elimination of waste.
*   **Defenses:**
    *   **Mouth:** Saliva (lysozyme, IgA, mucus), mechanical action of chewing/tongue.
    *   **Stomach:** Highly acidic gastric juice (HCl, pH 1.5-3.5), enzymes (pepsin).
    *   **Small Intestine:** Enzymes, bile, Peyer's patches (lymphoid tissue), peristalsis.
    *   **Large Intestine:** Mucus, peristalsis, enormous population of normal microbiota.
*   **Normal Microbiota:**
    *   **Mouth:** Numerous species (streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces, yeasts). Biofilm formation (dental plaque).
    *   **Stomach:** Few microbes due to acidity (*Helicobacter pylori* can survive).
    *   **Small Intestine:** Numbers increase towards large intestine.
    *   **Large Intestine (Colon):** Largest microbial population in the body (>10<sup>11</sup> bacteria per gram of feces). Primarily anaerobes (*Bacteroides*, *Clostridium*) and facultative anaerobes (*Escherichia coli*, *Enterobacter*, *Lactobacillus*).
    *   **Functions of Gut Microbiota:** Vitamin synthesis (K, B vitamins), digestion of complex carbohydrates, protection against pathogens (competitive exclusion), development/maturation of immune system.

## 24.2 Bacterial Infections of the Mouth
*   **Dental Caries (Tooth Decay):**
    *   Caused primarily by *Streptococcus mutans* and other acidogenic bacteria.
    *   Bacteria metabolize sugars (especially sucrose) to lactic acid, which demineralizes tooth enamel.
    *   Dextran (a polysaccharide produced by *S. mutans* from sucrose) helps bacteria adhere to teeth, forming dental plaque (a biofilm).
    *   Progression: Enamel decay -> dentin decay -> pulpitis (infection of pulp).
    *   Prevention: Dietary restriction of sugar, regular brushing/flossing, fluoride.
*   **Periodontal Disease:** Inflammation and degeneration of structures supporting the teeth (gingiva, periodontal ligament, bone).
    *   **Gingivitis:** Inflammation of the gums. Caused by plaque accumulation at gum line. Reversible.
    *   **Periodontitis:** Progression of gingivitis. Gums recede, pockets form between teeth and gums, bone destruction, tooth loss. Often involves anaerobic bacteria (e.g., *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, *Tannerella forsythia*).
*   **Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG, Trench Mouth):** Severe gingivitis with pain, bleeding gums, foul breath, ulceration. Associated with spirochetes (e.g., *Treponema vincentii*) and other anaerobes.

## 24.3 Bacterial Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract
*   **Gastroenteritis:** Inflammation of the stomach and intestinal mucosa. Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps.
*   **Infection vs. Intoxication:**
    *   **Infection:** Pathogen colonizes and grows in GI tract, then causes damage or produces toxins. Incubation period usually 12 hours to weeks. Often fever.
    *   **Intoxication:** Ingestion of preformed toxins produced by bacteria in food. Rapid onset of symptoms (1-48 hours). Usually no fever.
*   **Staphylococcal Food Poisoning (Intoxication):**
    *   Caused by ingestion of enterotoxin produced by *Staphylococcus aureus* in contaminated food (e.g., custards, potato salad, ham).
    *   Toxin is heat-stable. Rapid onset (1-6 hours). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps.
*   **Shigellosis (Bacillary Dysentery):**
    *   Caused by *Shigella* spp. (Gram-negative rods, e.g., *S. dysenteriae*, *S. sonnei*).
    *   Infection. Invade intestinal epithelial cells, multiply intracellularly, spread to adjacent cells.
    *   *S. dysenteriae* produces Shiga toxin (A-B exotoxin, inhibits protein synthesis, damages intestinal cells, can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome - HUS).
    *   Symptoms: Severe diarrhea with blood and mucus (dysentery), abdominal cramps, fever. Low ID<sub>50</sub>.
*   **Salmonellosis (Salmonella Gastroenteritis):**
    *   Caused by *Salmonella enterica* serovars (e.g., *S. Enteritidis*, *S. Typhimurium*) (Gram-negative rods).
    *   Infection. Invade intestinal mucosa, multiply.
    *   Sources: Contaminated poultry, eggs, meat, pet reptiles.
    *   Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever. Usually self-limiting.
*   **Typhoid Fever:**
    *   Caused by *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi. More severe systemic illness.
    *   Bacteria spread from intestine to bloodstream, then to organs.

*   **Cholera:**
    *   Caused by *Vibrio cholerae* (Gram-negative, curved rod).
    *   Produces cholera toxin (enterotoxin, A-B type) which causes intestinal cells to secrete large amounts of electrolytes and water.
    *   Symptoms: Profuse, watery diarrhea ("rice water stools"), vomiting, severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, shock.
    *   Transmission: Contaminated water or food.
    *   Treatment: Oral rehydration therapy (ORT), IV fluids, antibiotics.
