      "text": "Describe main cause of Plasmodium falciparum infection symptoms.",
      "answer": "The main symptoms of P. falciparum malaria (fever, chills, anemia, organ damage) are primarily caused by the asexual erythrocytic (blood) stage of the parasite's life cycle. When merozoites invade red blood cells (RBCs), replicate, and then cause the RBCs to rupture, they release more merozoites, parasite metabolic waste products, and cellular debris into the bloodstream. This synchronous rupture triggers a strong inflammatory response, leading to cyclical fevers and chills. Anemia results from RBC destruction. P. falciparum can also cause RBCs to adhere to capillary walls (cytoadherence), obstructing blood flow and leading to severe complications like cerebral malaria.",
      "explanation": "Symptoms are mainly due to the rupture of infected red blood cells by Plasmodium merozoites, releasing parasitic waste and cellular debris, which triggers inflammatory responses (fever, chills). Anemia results from RBC destruction. Cytoadherence of infected RBCs in P. falciparum causes severe complications."

      "answer": "Cats can be infected with Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite. Infected cats shed T. gondii oocysts in their feces. If a pregnant person ingests these oocysts (e.g., by handling contaminated litter and then touching their mouth), they can acquire toxoplasmosis. Congenital toxoplasmosis (infection passed to the fetus) can cause serious birth defects, neurological damage, or fetal death, especially if infection occurs early in pregnancy. Using gloves and thorough handwashing reduces the risk.",

      "answer": "Bacteremia refers to the presence of bacteria in the blood. While serious, it may be transient and not always cause severe illness. Septicemia, however, implies that bacteria are actively multiplying in the bloodstream and are associated with systemic signs of illness (sepsis). Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septicemia can rapidly progress to sepsis and septic shock, which involves severe hypotension and organ failure, making it far more immediately dangerous than simple bacteremia.",

      "text": "Why are most vascular pathogens poorly communicable from person to person?",
      "answer": "Many vascular pathogens (those infecting the bloodstream or circulatory system) require specific modes of transmission to enter the bloodstream. This often involves: 1. Arthropod vectors (e.g., ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, lice) that inject the pathogen directly into the blood during a bite. 2. Contaminated needles or medical procedures. 3. Deep wounds that allow direct entry into tissues and then the bloodstream. Casual person-to-person contact (like respiratory droplets or skin contact) is usually not sufficient for these pathogens to access the vascular system and establish infection, unlike pathogens that primarily infect mucosal surfaces like the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts.",
      "explanation": "Vascular pathogens typically require direct entry into the bloodstream. This often occurs via arthropod vectors, contaminated needles, or deep wounds, rather than through casual person-to-person contact like respiratory droplets, which transmit other types of pathogens more easily."

      "text": "Which is a bigger threat to the US population, Ebola or yellow fever? Why?",
      "answer": "Currently, yellow fever could be considered a bigger potential threat to the US population if introduced, although both are serious. Reasons: 1. Vector presence: The Aedes aegypti mosquito, a competent vector for yellow fever, is present in parts of the southern US. While Ebola can be transmitted person-to-person via direct contact with body fluids, it does not have an established arthropod vector in the US. 2. Vaccine: A highly effective vaccine exists for yellow fever, but its uptake might not be universal if an outbreak occurred. There are now FDA-approved vaccines for Ebola, but their deployment would depend on the specific outbreak scenario. 3. Historical context: Yellow fever caused significant outbreaks in the US historically. While Ebola outbreaks have been devastating in Africa, sustained transmission in the US has been prevented by strong public health responses. However, the risk for both depends on importation of cases and the effectiveness of public health measures.",
      "explanation": "Yellow fever might be a bigger potential threat due to the presence of its mosquito vector (Aedes aegypti) in parts of the US. While Ebola is highly virulent, its person-to-person transmission (via body fluids) has been contained in the US with robust public health measures. Both depend on importation and control."

Case management: Effective treatment of infected individuals to clear parasites and prevent them from being a source for mosquito infection. 4. Public awareness: Educating travelers to malaria-endemic areas about preventive measures (prophylaxis, repellents, bed nets) and the importance of seeking medical attention if symptoms develop after travel. 5. Blood supply screening: Although rare, transfusion-transmitted malaria is possible, so vigilance in blood donor screening is important.",
