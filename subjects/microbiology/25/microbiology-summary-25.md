# Chapter 25: Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections - Summary

## 25.1 Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems
*   **Circulatory System:** Heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries), blood.
    *   **Blood:** Plasma (liquid matrix) and formed elements (RBCs, WBCs, platelets).
    *   Normally sterile; presence of microbes in blood is a sign of infection.
*   **Lymphatic System:** Lymph, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, tonsils, Peyer's patches.
    *   **Functions:** Returns excess fluid from tissues to blood, transports absorbed fats, site of immune responses.
    *   Lymph nodes filter lymph, contain lymphocytes and macrophages.
    *   Spleen filters blood, removes old RBCs, site of immune responses.
    *   Normally sterile.
*   **Terminology:**
    *   **Bacteremia:** Presence of bacteria in the blood.
    *   **Viremia:** Presence of viruses in the blood.
    *   **Fungemia:** Presence of fungi in the blood.
    *   **Toxemia:** Presence of toxins in the blood.
    *   **Septicemia (Sepsis):** Acute illness caused by presence of pathogens or their toxins in the blood. Systemic inflammatory response.
    *   **Sepsis:** Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.
    *   **Septic Shock:** Sepsis with persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors. High mortality. Often associated with Gram-negative endotoxins, but can be Gram-positive bacteria or fungi.
    *   **Lymphangitis:** Inflammation of lymphatic vessels, often visible as red streaks under the skin.

## 25.2 Bacterial Infections of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems
*   **Bacterial Sepsis and Septic Shock:**
    *   Often begins as focal infection, bacteria enter bloodstream.
    *   Gram-negative sepsis: Endotoxins (LPS) trigger massive release of cytokines (e.g., TNF-Î±, IL-1), leading to fever, vasodilation, increased permeability, drop in blood pressure, DIC, organ failure.
    *   Gram-positive sepsis: Exotoxins (e.g., superantigens), cell wall components (peptidoglycan, teichoic acids) can also trigger sepsis.
    *   **Puerperal Sepsis (Childbed Fever):** Nosocomial infection of uterus after childbirth or abortion. Often caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*.
*   **Infective Endocarditis:**
    *   Inflammation of the endocardium (inner lining of heart chambers and valves).
    *   **Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis (SBE):** Slow onset, often caused by alpha-hemolytic streptococci (e.g., *Streptococcus viridans*) from oral cavity, or *Staphylococcus epidermidis*. Usually affects individuals with pre-existing heart valve abnormalities. Bacteria colonize damaged valves, form vegetations (biofilms).
    *   **Acute Bacterial Endocarditis:** Rapid onset, more severe, often caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*. Can affect healthy heart valves.
    *   Symptoms: Fever, heart murmur, fatigue, anemia. Vegetations can break off (emboli), causing strokes or damage to other organs.
    *   Diagnosis: Blood cultures, echocardiogram.
*   **Rheumatic Fever:**
    *   Autoimmune complication following *Streptococcus pyogenes* pharyngitis (strep throat).
    *   Antibodies against streptococcal M protein cross-react with heart tissue (especially valves), joints, skin, brain.
    *   Symptoms: Fever, arthritis, carditis (inflammation of heart, can cause permanent valve damage), subcutaneous nodules, chorea (Sydenham's chorea - involuntary movements).
    *   Preventable by prompt antibiotic treatment of strep throat.
*   **Tularemia ("Rabbit Fever"):**
    *   Caused by *Francisella tularensis* (Gram-negative coccobacillus). Highly infectious (low ID<sub>50</sub>).
    *   Zoonosis; reservoirs include rabbits, rodents, ticks, deer flies.
    *   Transmission: Handling infected animals, tick/deer fly bites, inhalation, ingestion of contaminated food/water.
    *   Symptoms: Ulcer at entry site (ulceroglandular form), swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills. Can cause pneumonia if inhaled.
*   **Brucellosis (Undulant Fever):**
    *   Caused by *Brucella* spp. (e.g., *B. melitensis*, *B. abortus*, *B. suis*) (Gram-negative coccobacilli).
    *   Zoonosis; reservoirs include cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs.
    *   Transmission: Contact with infected animals or their products (unpasteurized milk/dairy), inhalation.

*   **Anthrax:**
    *   Caused by *Bacillus anthracis* (Gram-positive, endospore-forming rod). Produces exotoxins (edema toxin, lethal toxin).
    *   Zoonosis; reservoirs include cattle, sheep, goats.
    *   **Forms:**
        *   **Cutaneous Anthrax:** Most common. Endospores enter skin lesion, form black eschar. Low mortality if treated.
        *   **Gastrointestinal Anthrax:** Ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat. Nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea. Higher mortality.
        *   **Inhalational (Pulmonary) Anthrax:** Inhalation of endospores. Initial flu-like symptoms, then rapid progression to severe respiratory distress, septic shock. High mortality. Bioterrorism concern.
    *   Vaccine available for high-risk individuals.

## 25.4 Protozoan and Helminthic Infections of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems
*   **Malaria:**
    *   Caused by *Plasmodium* spp. (apicomplexan protozoa: *P. falciparum*, *P. vivax*, *P. ovale*, *P. malariae*, *P. knowlesi*). *P. falciparum* is most severe.
    *   Vector: Female *Anopheles* mosquitoes.
    *   Life Cycle: Complex, involves mosquito (sexual stage) and human (asexual stage - liver and RBCs).
        *   Mosquito injects sporozoites -> infect liver cells -> mature into merozoites -> infect RBCs -> multiply in RBCs, causing rupture (releasing more merozoites and toxins). Some merozoites develop into gametocytes, ingested by mosquito.

*   **Toxoplasmosis:**
    *   Caused by *Toxoplasma gondii* (apicomplexan protozoan).
    *   Definitive host: Cats (shed oocysts in feces). Intermediate hosts: mammals, birds.
    *   Transmission to humans: Ingestion of oocysts from cat feces (contaminated soil, litter boxes), ingestion of undercooked meat containing tissue cysts, congenital transmission.
    *   Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic or mild flu-like illness in healthy individuals. Can cause severe disease in immunocompromised (e.g., encephalitis) and congenital toxoplasmosis (can lead to birth defects, blindness, neurological damage).
*   **Chagas' Disease (American Trypanosomiasis):**
    *   Caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi* (flagellated protozoan).
    *   Vector: Triatomine bugs ("kissing bugs"). Bug defecates while feeding, trypomastigotes in feces enter bite wound or mucous membranes.

*   **Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia):** (See Ch 24, but eggs can travel via blood to liver/spleen causing pathology)
    *   Caused by *Schistosoma* spp. (blood flukes).
    *   Cercariae penetrate skin, mature into adult worms in blood vessels (portal or bladder veins). Eggs cause inflammation, granulomas in liver, intestine, bladder.
*   **Filariasis (Lymphatic Filariasis / Elephantiasis):**
    *   Caused by thread-like nematodes (*Wuchereria bancrofti*, *Brugia malayi*, *B. timori*).
    *   Vector: Mosquitoes.
    *   Adult worms live in lymphatic vessels, block lymph flow, leading to lymphedema (swelling), eventually elephantiasis (gross enlargement and hardening of limbs, scrotum).
