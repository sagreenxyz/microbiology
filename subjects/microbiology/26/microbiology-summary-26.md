# Chapter 26: Nervous System Infections - Summary

## 26.1 Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the Nervous System
*   **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Brain and spinal cord.
    *   Protected by bone (skull, vertebral column), meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
    *   **Meninges:** Three membranes covering brain and spinal cord:
        1.  **Dura mater:** Outermost, tough layer.
        2.  **Arachnoid mater:** Middle, web-like layer. Subarachnoid space contains CSF.
        3.  **Pia mater:** Innermost, delicate layer, adheres to brain/spinal cord.
    *   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** Circulates in subarachnoid space, ventricles of brain, central canal of spinal cord. Provides cushioning, nutrients, waste removal. Normally sterile.
    *   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB):** Specialized capillaries with tight junctions that restrict passage of substances (including microbes and many drugs) from blood into CNS.
*   **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Nerves that branch from CNS (cranial nerves, spinal nerves).
*   **Normal Microbiota:** The nervous system is normally sterile; no normal microbiota.

## 26.2 Bacterial Infections of the Nervous System
*   **Bacterial Meningitis:** Inflammation of the meninges. Medical emergency.
    *   Symptoms: Fever, severe headache, stiff neck (nuchal rigidity), nausea, vomiting, photophobia, altered mental status.
    *   Diagnosis: CSF analysis via lumbar puncture (increased WBCs, protein; decreased glucose; Gram stain, culture, antigen tests).
    *   **Common Causes:**
        *   ***Streptococcus pneumoniae* (Pneumococcal Meningitis):** Leading cause in adults. Gram-positive diplococcus, capsule. Vaccine available.
        *   ***Neisseria meningitidis* (Meningococcal Meningitis):** Gram-negative diplococcus, capsule. Causes epidemic meningitis. Petechial rash common. Vaccine available.
        *   ***Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib Meningitis):** Gram-negative coccobacillus, capsule. Was leading cause in young children before Hib vaccine.
        *   ***Listeria monocytogenes* (Listeriosis):** Gram-positive rod. Foodborne. Can cross placenta, infect fetus. Affects newborns, elderly, immunocompromised.
        *   ***Streptococcus agalactiae* (Group B Streptococcus - GBS):** Leading cause of neonatal meningitis.
    *   Pathogens often enter CNS from bloodstream or via direct extension from nearby infection (e.g., sinusitis, otitis media).
*   **Tetanus ("Lockjaw"):**
    *   Caused by *Clostridium tetani* (Gram-positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming rod).
    *   Spores found in soil, enter deep wounds.
    *   Produces tetanospasmin (A-B neurotoxin) that blocks release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (glycine, GABA) in CNS, leading to sustained muscle contraction (spastic paralysis).
    *   Symptoms: Muscle stiffness (jaw first - trismus), spasms, opisthotonos (arched back). Can affect respiratory muscles.
    *   Prevented by DTaP/Tdap vaccine (tetanus toxoid). Treatment: Tetanus immune globulin (TIG), antibiotics, muscle relaxants.
*   **Botulism:**
    *   Caused by *Clostridium botulinum* (Gram-positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming rod).
    *   Produces botulinum toxin (A-B neurotoxin), one of the most potent toxins known. Blocks release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, causing flaccid paralysis.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Foodborne Botulism:** Ingestion of preformed toxin in improperly canned foods or preserved fish.
        *   **Infant Botulism:** Ingestion of *C. botulinum* spores (e.g., from honey), which germinate and produce toxin in infant's intestine. Most common form in US.
        *   **Wound Botulism:** Spores contaminate a wound.
    *   Symptoms: Double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, muscle weakness, descending paralysis. Respiratory failure can occur.
    *   Treatment: Antitoxin, supportive care (mechanical ventilation).
*   **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease):**
    *   Caused by *Mycobacterium leprae* (acid-fast rod, obligate intracellular).
    *   Prefers cooler body temperatures (infects skin, peripheral nerves).
    *   Long incubation period (years).
    *   **Forms:**
        *   **Tuberculoid (Paucibacillary) Leprosy:** Strong cell-mediated immune response. Few skin lesions, loss of sensation in affected areas. Non-progressive.
        *   **Lepromatous (Multibacillary) Leprosy:** Weak cell-mediated response. Many skin lesions, nodules, disfigurement (e.g., leonine facies). Progressive.
    *   Transmission: Prolonged close contact with infected individuals (nasal secretions). Not highly contagious.
    *   Treatment: Long-term multi-drug therapy (e.g., dapsone, rifampin, clofazimine).

## 26.3 Viral Infections of the Nervous System
*   **Viral Meningitis (Aseptic Meningitis):**
    *   More common and usually milder than bacterial meningitis. CSF shows lymphocytes (not neutrophils), normal glucose.
    *   Common causes: Enteroviruses (most common), herpesviruses (HSV, VZV, EBV), mumps virus, arboviruses.
    *   Symptoms: Fever, headache, stiff neck, photophobia. Usually self-limiting.
*   **Poliomyelitis (Polio):**
    *   Caused by Poliovirus (enterovirus, Picornaviridae).
    *   Transmission: Fecal-oral route.
    *   Most infections are asymptomatic or cause mild flu-like illness.
    *   In <1% of cases, virus invades CNS, destroys motor neurons in spinal cord and brainstem, leading to paralytic poliomyelitis (flaccid paralysis).
    *   **Bulbar polio:** Affects respiratory muscles.
    *   **Post-polio syndrome:** Muscle weakness/paralysis years after recovery.
    *   Prevention: Vaccines - Salk vaccine (Inactivated Polio Vaccine - IPV, injectable) and Sabin vaccine (Oral Polio Vaccine - OPV, live attenuated, no longer used in US due to risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio). Global eradication efforts ongoing.
*   **Rabies:**
    *   Caused by Rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae, lyssavirus). Bullet-shaped.
    *   Zoonosis; transmitted by bite or saliva of infected animal (dogs, bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes).
    *   Virus travels along peripheral nerves to CNS, causes fatal encephalitis.
    *   Long incubation period (weeks to months).
    *   Symptoms:
        *   Prodromal: Fever, headache, malaise, pain/tingling at bite site.
        *   Furious Rabies: Agitation, hydrophobia (fear of water due to painful swallowing spasms), delirium, seizures.
        *   Paralytic (Dumb) Rabies: Gradual paralysis.
    *   Almost always fatal once symptoms appear.
    *   Diagnosis: Detection of viral antigen in brain tissue (Negri bodies - intracytoplasmic inclusions) or saliva/skin.
    *   Prevention/Treatment:
        *   Pre-exposure prophylaxis (vaccine) for high-risk individuals.
        *   Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): Wound cleaning, rabies immune globulin (RIG) infiltrated at wound site and IM, and series of rabies vaccine injections. Must be given promptly.
*   **Arboviral Encephalitis:**
    *   Encephalitis caused by arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).
    *   Vector: Mosquitoes primarily. Reservoirs: Birds, small mammals.
    *   Examples:
        *   **West Nile Virus (WNV) Encephalitis:** Most common arboviral encephalitis in US. Most infections asymptomatic or mild fever (West Nile fever). Severe cases develop neuroinvasive disease (meningitis, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis).
        *   **Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE):** High mortality.
        *   **Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE).**
